His outstretched arm hits conspicuously empty space, and the blanket is cold when he slides his arm upwards. He remembers waking earlier in a sleep haze, but it\u2019d been dark and gray outside and Sungyeol had been pulled back down under the blankets, told to go back to sleep. It\u2019s still early, early enough that his weekend alarm has yet to go off. </p><p>He lies there for a few more minutes, awake, toeing the boundary of a new day. It\u2019s tempting to burrow under the covers, but it\u2019s not something he can put off forever, and eventually he does crawl to the edge of the bed and swings himself upright. The blood rushes from his head, and he groans as he stands, vision temporarily black. The carpet is soft against his bare feet as he shuffles to the kitchen\u2014the tile there is a cool shock. </p><p>He\u2019s awake. </p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Sungyeol grumbles. He leans against the wall, rubs at his eyes with the back of his hand. </p><p>Woohyun turns from the stove, spatula still in hand. He\u2019s there as if he belongs, as if it\u2019s normal for him to fit into this picture, at Sungyeol\u2019s stove, in Sungyeol\u2019s kitchen. He breaks into that annoying shit eating grin when he sees Sungyeol standing there. </p><p>\"Making breakfast, obviously,\" he says. </p><p>Obviously. There\u2019s a plate stacked with pancakes, and batter still in the mixing bowl. Woohyun\u2019s gone back to ignoring him, focussing his attention towards the stove. Sungyeol grimaces at his back for a good second. </p><p>\"Who asked you to do that?\" he snaps. He reaches around around Woohyun for the dishcloth, aggressively wiping the thin patches of flour that\u2019ve spilled on the counter. </p><p>\"Well look who\u2019s a ray of sunshine,\" Woohyun hums. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s rolled out of bed and he\u2019s still wearing what he\u2019d slept in, and it\u2019s a stark difference next to Woohyun, fully dressed, button down shirt and neat jeans and socks and all. He flips the pancake, one sharp movement of his wrist, and Sungyeol mentally curses him for being able to do everything so god damned perfectly. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll make coffee.\" It\u2019s one smell that\u2019s conspicuously missing, one gap that he can fill. </p><p>Woohyun makes a sound that's probably agreement, or maybe even some sort of thanks. </p><p>\"And why pancakes?\" Sungyeol adds. There\u2019s a faint hint of desperation rising inside him, and it makes no sense, and he pushes it back down. \"We could\u2019ve just had cereal, I don\u2019t\u2014\" </p><p>\"You can have cereal again if you don\u2019t want it,\" Woohyun says. He grins cheekily at him, the one that borders a smirk, and slides the last one onto the plate. </p><p>\"God, this makes it feel like we\u2019re boyfriends or something,\" Sungyeol says, and for a brief moment, the smile slips from Woohyun\u2019s face. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t take the bait\u2014what bait?\u2014only reaches for more plates. </p><p>They settle down for breakfast in near silence, Sungyeol carrying the coffee, Woohyun bringing the food. His hair is pushed back from his face, and it\u2019s a soft brown, and he looks less young. The food is good, like always, and Sungyeol shovels it into his mouth, while Woohyun cuts it into neat pieces, eating methodically. </p><p>He kicks Woohyun under the table, and Woohyun\u2019s eyes flicker up in surprise. </p><p>\"What was that for?\" he says. </p><p>\"For being annoying,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Wow, look who\u2019s talking.\" Woohyun scoffs, and kicks him back\u2014only it has no heat in it, and ends with Woohyun sliding his socked foot up Sungyeol\u2019s shin. Woohyun\u2019s eyes are steady, and Sungyeol jerks his leg away, and Sungyeol buries his face in his coffee. </p><p>\"Well,\" Woohyun says, scraping back his chair. His plate is empty. \"I better be going. I cooked, so you get the dishes.\" </p><p>\"I knew I\u2019d be cleaning up your mess,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun laughs, loud and obnoxious as always. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t miss me too much,\" he says, as he heads for the door. </p><p>Sungyeol stands as well. It doesn\u2019t feel right, Woohyun letting himself out like that, even if he has before, and even if he could. He watches as Woohyun grabs his bag, his coat, his new scarf, Sungyeol hovering as Woohyun puts on his shoes. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, as Woohyun opens the door. </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>Sungyeol isn\u2019t thinking\u2014Sungyeol pushes the door shut, before it\u2019s barely had a chance to click open. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s mouth opens in surprise. Sungyeol grabs Woohyun by the shirt, pulling him close, crushing their mouths together. His things fall to the floor with a quiet thump. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s tongue slips between Woohyun\u2019s parted lips, and he catches his lip between tongue and teeth. His other hand slides up Woohyun\u2019s back, cupping the back of Woohyun\u2019s neck. Woohyun\u2019s mouth is hot against his, and his body is hot against him. The heat floods his body, floods his mind. There\u2019s the unmistakable bulge pressing against his thigh, as Woohyun slowly regains his senses and kisses him back. Sungyeol moans into his mouth, and the door is far from soundproof, but he doesn\u2019t care. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s lips are wet and slick when Sungyeol draws back just enough to take a deep breath, and this time, he uses a bit more teeth than necessary, and there\u2019s a quiet hiss as Woohyun pulls away. His face is flushed\u2014Sungyeol\u2019s own chest is tight, his head dizzying with a need for air. </p><p>Woohyun fingers dig into Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, and in a flash, he turns their positions, pushing Sungyeol against the door, his back thudding hard against it. Woohyun says nothing, but he doesn\u2019t need to, just kisses Sungyeol hungrily. Sungyeol whines, grinding up against Woohyun with need. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s body is flushed with heat, and Woohyun\u2019s tongue is in his mouth, exploring it as if he\u2019s never done this before. One of his hands slip under Sungyeol\u2019s tank, and it\u2019s pressed between them, palm against his chest. Woohyun smells of shampoo and the faded scent of detergent. He holds Sungyeol down, even as Sungyeol tries to pull away for air. </p><p>His fingers bruise against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and Sungyeol shoves, really shoves, gasping. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s eyes are sharp. </p><p>He\u2019s breathing hard too, his chest rises and falls as fast as his heart is beating, and his lips are red and wet. </p><p>And then Woohyun\u2019s mouth is hot against his skin. </p><p>\"Ahh\u2014\" </p><p>The heat of pleasure shoots through Sungyeol, Woohyun sucking at the side of his neck, his mouth a tight seal, and fuck, he bares his neck, fuck, he feels like he could come right now, just from Woohyun\u2019s mouth, like this\u2014It\u2019s a good thing Woohyun\u2019s so much shorter than him\u2014the thought flits through his mind, but then Woohyun\u2019s kissing down the line of his jaw, and Sungyeol grasps at the back of Woohyun\u2019s shirt, fabric bunching between his fingers. His tongue flickers against his skin, and then his mouth is at the crook of his neck, and god, fuck, it feels so good and Sungyeol already knows it\u2019s going to leave a mark, and it\u2019s hot, hot, hot and Sungyeol clings to him, knowing he\u2019s whining, knowing the sounds that slip out of his open mouth are as incoherent as sounds can be, but he knows that it\u2019s filled with as much need as he feels. Woohyun\u2019s palm still pins Sungyeol against the door, and Sungyeol grounds himself in that. </p><p>\"I\u2026\" </p><p>\"Mmm,\" Woohyun hums. It rings against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and then there\u2019s teeth closing around it\u2014and then his hand has slipped beneath the elastic of Sungyeol\u2019s shorts, fingers brushing against the head of Sungyeol\u2019s cock through his underwear. </p><p>His world explodes. He buries his face against Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, cries muffled in his shirt. Fuck, it isn\u2019t that he\u2019s missed this, it\u2019s that\u2014everything narrows down to Woohyun\u2019s fingers playing against him, and his senses are flooded with the sensation of touch, and each moment sends sharp shockwaves through his bones. </p><p>Sungyeol comes down with a quiet moan, his muscles falling slack, as he wraps his arms around Woohyun\u2019s chest. </p><p>Woohyun steps away, and Sungyeol nearly falls. </p><p>\"Have a good day,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>His hair is mussed, falling over his eyes, his shirt rumpled and untucked.  </p><p>Sungyeol presses a hand against his neck, and watches him go.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><hr /><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s raining, in that incessant way it does, every other year in the join between winter and spring, spring and summer. Sungyeol wanders between the windows and his desk, willing it to lighten, half heartedly doing work in the meantime. It\u2019s wet and gray and nearing six. The office is far from empty, but Sungyeol prefers to come in early to avoid the morning rush. The city, through the rain speckled windows, is muted, some six floors below. It\u2019s also a steady stream of black umbrellas, sweeping towards the entrance of the underground pathway. The office itself is its usual gray cubicle walls and ugly purple-green carpet, and it seems to match the mood outside. He catches more than a few screens with discreetly open windows of Youtube and Facebook; he makes scoffing faces at the backs of the owners, faking being hard at work. Well, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s never been guilty of the same. He drops back into his seat, kicking at the edge of the desk in frustration. There\u2019s a noise of irritation on the other side of the divider, and Sungyeol says a sheepish sorry. </p><p>His phone lights up with a text. </p><p><tt>wanna come over?</tt> </p><p>It sits in his hand for a moment, and then Sungyeol drops it as if it burns. </p><p>It sits on the table for a moment, the screen flickering black but the notification light blinking like an accusation. Sungyeol picks it up. </p><p><tt>no</tt> he shoots back. </p><p><tt>pity :(</tt> The reply comes almost immediately. Sungyeol\u2019s ready to send a suitably scathing text back when another message pops up again.  </p><p><tt>sure? kibum\u2019s gonna be here too. just to chill.</tt> </p><p>The thing about friendships was that it was easier to break them than it was to pick them back up. <i>We won\u2019t be alone</i>, is what Woohyun means. <i>It won\u2019t be like last time. The last few times.</i> </p><p>Chance meetings, and it\u2019s impossible to pretend not to know each other, and it\u2019s maybe more impossible to pretend they don\u2019t want to try, to cobble back together something that resembles friendship. Icy silences, a dance between two people eager to avoid the other, but equally eager to attempt it, like the adults they were instead of the kids they\u2019d been. That Sungyeol had been. </p><p>Sungyeol shoves his phone into his bag. The rain doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be ending any time soon. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s in any hurry to get home\u2014it\u2019s nice, living alone, but sometimes it\u2019s a little quiet, a little empty. Maybe he should get a dog. He keeps thinking about that. </p><p>Woohyun lives two subway stops away, the awkward distance where he should walk, but at the same time, just far enough that it could be justified, especially when he has a monthly pass, and there\u2019s no point in not using it. It\u2019s raining, but maybe it\u2019s better that way. </p><p>\"I thought you weren\u2019t coming?\" Woohyun says. There\u2019s a wicked glint in his eyes, once the brief flash of surprise has melted into his signature smile.  </p><p>\"Has anyone told you you\u2019re insufferable lately?\" Sungyeol asks. Woohyun takes his umbrella and the beer, and Sungyeol shoves past him, kicking his shoes off into the tangled pile, the ankles of his pants uncomfortably wet from where the umbrella was no help. </p><p>\"Look who\u2019s talking,\" Woohyun laughs. </p><p>It\u2019s a nice apartment, and a familiar one, all sleek and wooden floors and modern. The kitchen\u2019s a little on the small side, but that just means a bigger living room. Sungyeol rakes his eyes over everything that hasn\u2019t changed, the large TV, the fold out couch, Sunggyu\u2019s laptop under the coffee table, displaced by a large bowl of chips, a mix of ketchup and regular. The door to the bathroom is next to the kitchen, and next to Woohyun\u2019s room. It\u2019s a little smaller than Sunggyu\u2019s master bedroom, but still big enough for a full sized bed and a desk. The door\u2019s half open, but the lights are off. Sunggyu and Dongwoo have settled themselves on the floor, and are beating the shit out of each other on Sunggyu\u2019s old N64, and Kibum is there, as promised, perched on the side of the couch and cheering them both on. </p><p>\"Glad you could show up,\" Kibum says. </p><p>Dongwoo turns to shoot him a happy grin, but then Sunggyu combos him and he\u2019s back to the screen, shocked that Sunggyu was playing dirty. </p><p>\"Who\u2019s winning?\" Sungyeol asks. He throws himself onto the couch next to Kibum, grabbing a handful of chips and shoving them into his mouth.  Woohyun is putting the beer Sungyeol had brought into the fridge.  </p><p>\"Three to two,\" Kibum says, just as Sunggyu ends it with a final attack, and Dongwoo\u2019s character flies off the stage. Kibum raises his eyebrows. \"Four to two,\" he amends. Dongwoo whines over losing in the background, head thrown back as he laughs.  </p><p>\"Anyone want to take over?\" Dongwoo leans back, offering the controller. </p><p>Kibum takes it, and slides down to where Dongwoo had been sitting. Dongwoo greets Sungyeol warmly, before literally skipping off to the kitchen to help Woohyun with whatever it was he was doing. </p><p>\"Long time no see,\" Sunggyu says. \"When\u2019s the last time you were here?\" </p><p>\"I knew you\u2019d missed me,\" Sungyeol says, making a heart with his hands. </p><p>\"Woohyun\u2019s rubbing off on you,\" Sunggyu says. Kibum\u2019s done selecting his character, and they both hit start. </p><p>Sungyeol watches two rounds, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to which of them are the loudest, Sungyeol included, before Woohyun interrupts them. He leans forward against Sungyeol, arms dangling over his shoulders, like he always (had always) does. </p><p>\"Hate to interrupt,\" he says cheerily, in a matter that says he doesn\u2019t at all, \"but any pizza requests?\" </p><p>\"Meat,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs Woohyun off, but Woohyun clings like a leech. </p><p>\"Hawaiian,\" Kibum tosses out, furiously mashing buttons. </p><p>\"And cheese as usual? Got it,\" Woohyun says. He finally pulls away, his touch still searing against Sungyeol\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"Should we switch to Smash after this round?\" Dongwoo suggests. \"Since there\u2019s more of us here now.\" </p><p>\"Extra controllers in my room!\" Woohyun calls out, holding the phone away from his face for a brief moment. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll go get it,\" Sungyeol says, already jumping over the back of the couch. He runs into the open door on the right, then fumbles in the dark room for a moment for the switch. It takes a few seconds, but he finds it eventually. </p><p>Sunggyu was right. It\u2019s been a while since the last time he\u2019s been over. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s room hasn\u2019t changed much, not that Sungyeol would\u2019ve expected it to. Bed on the right, closet on the left, desk a little messier than it usually is, which means work\u2019s probably been busy. He pulls open the closet. It\u2019s where Woohyun keeps most of his things, the ones that don\u2019t go anywhere else. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t notice, rummaging through the boxes, that there\u2019s someone behind him until Woohyun\u2019s hand is on his shoulder. </p><p>\"Fuck, you scared me,\" Sungyeol hisses. </p><p>Woohyun presses his lips together, then joins Sungyeol in unearthing them from the bottom of the box. </p><p>\"Stay?\" Woohyun asks. It\u2019s quiet, and so petulant that Sungyeol nearly scoffs. </p><p>\"I\u2019d better not,\" Sungyeol says. He stands, controller in hand, cable trailing behind him. Woohyun is still crouched down. There\u2019s a sigh as he follows Sungyeol out into the living room, the other controller in his hand. </p><p>Sungyeol should\u2019ve left first, or second. Probably should\u2019ve stood and gone when Kibum did, citing work tomorrow morning. He didn\u2019t, though, and then it was just him, Sunggyu, and Woohyun. </p><p>\"Are you staying over?\" Sunggyu asks. </p><p>He didn\u2019t know, Woohyun had told him once. </p><p>\"I probably shouldn\u2019t,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>He\u2019s had two and a half beers, the half because he\u2019d stolen it from Woohyun. Alcohol tends to mellow him out, and it doesn\u2019t take much. Myungsoo likes to jibe at him that he\u2019s much better that way, much easier to deal with.  </p><p>\"It\u2019s still raining,\" Woohyun says, and it\u2019s true. If anything, the rain\u2019s gotten heavier. Then: \"I\u2019ve still got the sleeping bag.\" </p><p>Sungyeol had used it once. Then Woohyun had said his bed was big enough, and it made more sense. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time, especially not since undergrad, too many people crowded into one room and empty bottles of alcohol stashed into trash bags they\u2019ll take out in the morning, but. And. </p><p>Woohyun, against the wall; Myungsoo, curled up against him; Sungyeol, sandwiched between them, too hot, and too aware of them both. </p><p>Sungyeol, against the wall; Woohyun half on top of him. </p><p>Woohyun\u2014 </p><p>They\u2019d been young. </p><p>\"I\u2019m heading to bed,\" Sunggyu says. He stands, and nods at Sungyeol. </p><p>\"It\u2019s not even eleven,\" Woohyun points out. \"Someone\u2019s getting old.\" </p><p>Sunggyu glares at him, his narrow eyes all but disappearing. \"I\u2019m only two years older\u2014and show some respect, kiddo.\" </p><p>\"Yes <i>hyung</i>,\" Woohyun says, at the same time Sungyeol laughs and says \"whatever, grandpa.\" </p><p>Sunggyu grumbles and disappears into the bathroom as Woohyun and Sungyeol high five each other, mumbling about disrespectful brats. </p><p>\"I do still have the sleeping bag,\" Woohyun says, after a moment. The silence has fallen back into the empty spaces, broken by the occasional sounds of running water. </p><p>Sungyeol hesitates. It\u2019s not even eleven, like Woohyun had said, and he doesn\u2019t live that far from here, rain or no. Five subway stops and a fifteen minute walk, if the busses weren\u2019t running by the time he got to his station. Not ideal, but he should. </p><p>Should and did, though, were very different things.  </p><p>\"Alright,\" he says. \"But I\u2019ll take the sleeping bag.\" </p><p>Woohyun nods, and disappears to pull it out from under the bed. Sungyeol waits a beat, then trails into the room behind him. There\u2019s a loose t-shirt and pair of shorts on the bed. </p><p>\"Unless you want to sleep in your work clothes,\" Woohyun says, when he notices Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I could\u2019ve slept in no clothes,\" Sungyeol says. He regrets it immediately. He snatches up the clothes before Woohyun can say anything, and turns around to change. </p><p>\"Nothing I haven\u2019t seen before,\" Woohyun murmurs from behind him. </p><p>A flush of embarrassment cascades down his skin. </p><p>He takes longer than he needs, unbuttoning his shirt, then pulling the t-shirt over his head faster than he usually does. When he turns around again, Woohyun is also changed. </p><p>\"Hyung\u2019s out of the bathroom, if you want it first,\" Woohyun says. \"Since you always complain I take too long.\" </p><p>\"Because you <i>do</i>,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Your spare toothbrush is still in the cabinet!\" Woohyun calls out from behind him. Sunyeol\u2019s pulse skips a beat in surprise. </p><p>It\u2019s been months\u2014but more than that, why hadn\u2019t he thrown it out, already? </p><p>\"Is it still safe to use?\" He shoots back. Sunggyu yells at them to keep it down through the closed door, and Sungyeol ignores him. </p><p>Woohyun just laughs at them both. </p><p>Woohyun does take forever, because he\u2019d clean his face twice, then spend at least fifteen minutes gently patting in who knew what serums or lotions or whatever onto his face. Sungyeol had watched him once, perched on the seat of the toilet. He\u2019d stalked off in frustration when it seemed like it\u2019d never end. </p><p>By the time Woohyun returns, hair damp from the shower and skin faintly glowing, Sungyeol has already rolled himself into the sleeping bag, his phone plugged into the wall with Woohyun\u2019s stolen charger. </p><p>\"You\u2019re sure?\" Woohyun asks. His voice is quiet, soft. Uncertain. For a moment, Sungyeol wonders who else has seen him like this\u2014who else\u2019s made him like this.  </p><p>Sungyeol answers by burying himself deeper into the sleeping bag. </p><p>He hears Woohyun sigh, and turn off the lights. </p><p>Sungyeol wakes partway through the night\u2014the rain has stopped, but through the half open blinds, the light of the city still glints from the lingering drops of water. He reaches blearily for his phone. In the pale blue glow of the screen, he sees Woohyun sleeping on the far side of the bed, the left side of the bed conspicuously empty. </p><p>Sungyeol switches off his phone, and tugs the sleeping bag over his head.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The first time Sungyeol sees Woohyun, the latter is at the front of the classroom, the first day of his Introductory Macroeconomics class. Way too young to be a professor, kind of cute, especially with those glasses\u2014but then Sungyeol discovers, loudly, that Woohyun isn\u2019t even a year older than him. </p><p>Some of the upper year students are less than pleased. </p><p>Him and Woohyun, they didn't quite get along. </p><p>(Sungyeol tends to pretend not to remember the end of that term, when they get into a yelling match in front of the entire class. He starts that one too.) </p><p>The first time Sungyeol sees Woohyun as a person, not stuck up lecturer with a chip on his shoulder, is in line at the coffee shop near the library. He\u2019s wearing a grey cardigan, hair falling over his eyes, and with the hallowed look of someone who hadn't slept in days. It\u2019s midterms, and Sungyeol\u2019s not surprised. He's staring at his phone, fingers listlessly tapping at the screen, a handful of change in his other hand. </p><p>Sungyeol opens his mouth, a sharp comment on the tip of his tongue. He doesn't. He leans back against the glass wall, hands shoved into his pockets, and watches Woohyun place his order, handing the cashier the exact change he\u2019d already picked out. A medium coffee, and bagel, toasted with butter. Sungyeol knows the drill. But it's when Woohyun turns, sliding his phone back into his pocket, and his eyes meet Sungyeol\u2019s\u2014for a split second, he freezes, and the line of tension running through his body is almost visible. </p><p>Sungyeol opens his mouth, and then closes it, but then Woohyun breaks out into a grin and says: \"are you stalking me?\" </p><p>\"Who\u2019d want to stalk <i>you</i>,\" Sungyeol snaps, and fuck that, he was an annoying piece of shit.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The office is nearly empty, the clock pushing seven. </p><p>Some of the lights have already flickered off, detecting no movement in good portions of the floor. Those that remain act as a spotlight, islands of after hours productivity, or non productivity.  </p><p>In Sungyeol\u2019s case, it\u2019s the latter.  </p><p>He leans back in his chair, elbows resting lightly on its arms, his fingers steepled. The smell of bagels, toasted with butter, flits through his memories, one well remembered from his university days. It\u2019s been a long time since then, and he\u2019s no longer a cash strapped time strapped student, bouncing between classes, tutorials, and the library.  </p><p>Hectic, horrible, stressed, terrified. Nerve wracking, might\u2019ve been the better way to put it. So he hadn\u2019t been the greatest student, hadn\u2019t spent as much time in the library as he should\u2019ve, but the fear of failure had always been there, as much as it\u2019d been for anyone else. He doesn\u2019t miss it, but at the same time, he does. Every assignment, every test, every paper, every exam\u2014all it took was one bad day, and it\u2019d be on your transcript forever, enough to knock you down in favour of one of your classmates. </p><p>Now, two jobs later, when it doesn\u2019t matter, he misses it, a little. Misery loves company, and he hadn\u2019t suffered alone. Myungsoo had helped, someone he\u2019d gone to high school with, someone who\u2019d he\u2019d taken all the same classes with\u2014but there\u2019d been a certain energy in a bunch of kids in their late teens, early twenties, that just didn\u2019t exist in the office. Hell, Sungyeol wasn\u2019t even sure if he still had that\u2014but the one time he\u2019d said that aloud to Myungsoo, Myungsoo had assured him he was just as childish as ever. </p><p>But it\u2019d been easier to laugh loudly, to complain loudly, to do everything with too much exuberance and eagerness, both the good and the bad. Chasing after deadlines just wasn\u2019t the same when it wasn\u2019t about you. Like chasing after a bus, only for the bus to get stuck in traffic. </p><p>With a sigh, Sungyeol finally gives up on the act, saving his work and locking up. He swings his bag over his shoulder and heads for the door. Not home, not yet, but he could do with a coffee. </p><p>The coffee shop is familiar. He doesn\u2019t stop at this one as often as he could, a bit out of the way from work, and during the day, it\u2019s busy and loud. </p><p>Now, at the end of the day, the place is quiet, and the only other table occupied were two highschoolers, bent over what looked like SAT prep books. Sungyeol absentmindedly orders his coffee, dumping in three packets of sugar before claiming a small table in the back corner. He leans back in the chair, coffee warm between his hands. The lighting here is soft, and the decorations match the whole wooden walls and quiet music. </p><p>\"You want to talk about it?\" Myungsoo had said. In line for coffee, frowning at Sungyeol. Someone had once described Myungsoo\u2019s eyes as dead, and Sungyeol could get where they were coming from, the look Myungsoo has when he\u2019s dazing off, his mind far elsewhere. But at that moment, Myungsoo\u2019s eyes were piercing through his skin, peeling away his thoughts. </p><p>\"Talk about what?\" Sungyeol had said. Myungsoo\u2019s eyes had narrowed at him, daring him to continue, to pretend that nothing was wrong. \"No. I don\u2019t,\" Sungyeol had said, instead. \"I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\" </p><p>\"Like you didn\u2019t want to talk over winter?\" Myungsoo had asked, and his eyes are sharp, and Sungyeol had looked away. </p><p>\"Shut up,\" he\u2019d said, and Myungsoo had dropped it, because they\u2019d gotten to the counter, and Myungsoo\u2019s always been more motivated by food than anything else\u2014but in this case, Sungyeol knows he\u2019s been given an out. It hadn\u2019t been why he\u2019d paid for both his large coffee and Myungsoo\u2019s iced cap, absolutely not. </p><p>Winter. </p><p>We need to talk, he'd said.</p><p>His phone rests on the table in front of him, next to his cooling coffee. His hand hovers over it briefly, before he scoops it up. He taps in a quick message and hits send before he can think too much of it. </p><p>The reply is almost instantaneous. </p><p><tt>nothing, at home, want to come over?</tt> </p><p><tt>no im busy</tt> </p><p><tt>get take out from next door</tt> </p><p>Sungyeol curses\u2014he couldn\u2019t at least ask why he was asking? just ordered him around instead?\u2014but he stuffs his phone into his pocket and nearly crushes his coffee with the other. Like he\u2019s actually going to\u2014 </p><p>Half an hour later, he\u2019s pushing open Woohyun\u2019s unlocked door, kicking his shoes off into the tangled pile. </p><p>Sunggyu doesn\u2019t seem to be home. </p><p>\"You better pay me back,\" Sungyeol calls out as he stalks into the apartment. </p><p>Woohyun emerges from the kitchen, carrying plates. </p><p>\"Mmm, broccoli chicken, right?\" he says, ignoring Sungyeol. </p><p>\"What if I hadn\u2019t shown up?\" Sungyeol says. He throws himself onto the couch. It sinks under his weight, a familiar sensation that almost feels like home. He grabs the remote and switches on the TV. </p><p>Woohyun shrugs and plucks the remote out of his hand, handing Sungyeol a pair of chopsticks in its place as he sits down next to him. The couch sinks under both their weights, and Sungyeol subtly shuffles away. </p><p>\"Cry in my room,\" Woohyun says. He flips past the news and a hockey game, before settling on some random documentary on Netflix.  </p><p>\"Where\u2019s Sunggyu?\" Sungyeol asks. It\u2019s about seals. He likes seals. </p><p>\"At his girlfriend\u2019s place, I think,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>He\u2019s still holding the remote. He leans forward to set it in its regular place, leans over Sungyeol. Sungyeol slaps him away, scowling, but the movement slides him closer to Sungyeol, and their knees touch. When Woohyun straightens, he doesn\u2019t move away. </p><p>\"For the night?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>Woohyun nods, apparently engrossed in the diet of the seals. </p><p>Sungyeol stands, the couch shifting under the loss of his weight. Woohyun glances up at him, the where are you going look. Sungyeol ignores him, weaving around the couch to the fridge like he\u2019s done a hundred times before. He yanks it open, grabs two beers, cracks them open, hands one to Woohyun, like he\u2019s done a hundred times before. </p><p>Maybe not quite a hundred, but the sentiment's the same. </p><p>\"I see you\u2019ve made yourself at home,\" Woohyun says quietly. </p><p>\"You\u2019re the one who told me don\u2019t be a stranger,\" Sungyeol says, words clipped. This time, he\u2019s the one to slide closer. </p><p>Woohyun stiffens, and takes a sip of his beer. </p><p>\"Yeah, but\u2026\" Woohyun trails off. </p><p>It\u2019s a far cry from the way Sungyeol had snapped at him for being insufferable and inexperienced all at the same time, and Woohyun finally losing his cool and telling Sungyeol that if he didn\u2019t like it, he could get out of the class. </p><p>Sungyeol wishes they still fought like that. Not that they were fighting, right now. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what they were, right now. </p><p>(Sungyeol\u2019s old enough now to recognize his own vindictive streaks, but never until long after it\u2019s happened.) </p><p>So he leans back, beer slowly warming in his hand, and learns about seals.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"I just asked what was up with your mood!\" Woohyun drags a hand across his face in exasperation. His expression is tired, and the lines around his mouth are taut.  </p><p>\"And I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, alright?\" Sungyeol snarls. He stalks into the kitchen, and then back, and Woohyun\u2019s still standing there in his living room, giving him the same confused, concerned, everything Sungyeol doesn\u2019t want right now look. \"And nothing! Nothing\u2019s up! And you\u2019re the last person I\u2019d talk to!\" </p><p>\"That's why you\u2019re throwing a temper tantrum, right? Like the baby you are?\" Woohyun\u2019s eyes flash at him, and Sungyeol knows he\u2019s finally pushed him past his limits, that he\u2019s finally pushed his limits one too many times. He\u2019s not\u2014he\u2019s not the last person he\u2019d talk to. Woohyun's arms are crossed over his chest, and his fingers have curled into fists. </p><p>\"Yeah? And your smug ass would know all about that\u2014you\u2026you\u2026\" </p><p>\"Run out of words? Can\u2019t figure out how to insult me?\" Woohyun taunts. </p><p>\"Is this your idea of comforting me?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Oh, I didn\u2019t know you wanted to be comforted.\" Woohyun\u2019s voice is contemptuous, and Sungyeol takes comfort in that. </p><p>\"Good, because I\u2019d be worried if you weren\u2019t trying to be a complete and total <i>dick</i>.\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Just leave it,\" Sungyeol says. His nails dig into his palms, and he turns, anything to avoid Woohyun\u2019s pitying eyes. </p><p>\"Look, Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"I said to leave it!\" </p><p>Woohyun reels back, hand falling from Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, hand flying to his face. Sungyeol drops his hand, bones throbbing where his fist had slammed into Woohyun. His eyes widen, and then they fall into that sad, puppy dog look, his mouth slightly parted, his brows slightly creased. </p><p>\"Get out,\" Sungyeol says. He swallows, his gut tight, everything falling away. Heat prickles at his eyes. His voice sounds dead to his own ears.  </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t move, and his hand is still covering his face, and Sungyeol wishes he\u2019d move it, because he wants to see, wants to know.  </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Just go!\" Sungyeol grabs Woohyun by the wrist, drags him to the door. Woohyun stumbles, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t care, just needs him gone. </p><p>It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s slammed the door behind Woohyun, as he wraps his arms around himself, pressing himself against the door, that he sees the umbrella still leaning against the wall. </p><p>The rain beats a staccato on the roof; each note brings his attention back to the lingering drops on the black fabric.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Oi, you get back here, Lee Sungjong!\" </p><p>\"Like heck I am!\" Sungjong yells over his shoulder, bolting down the sidewalk. He startles a flock of pigeons, taking to the air in a flurry of wings. </p><p>Sungyeol shoves past a laughing Sunggyu as he races after Sungjong. Sungjong doesn\u2019t have that much of a lead, and Sungyeol has longer legs. </p><p>\"Go easy on him!\" Woohyun calls out. \"I don\u2019t want to be the one to call his mom and tell her we got her son killed!\" </p><p>\"You shut up,\" Sungyeol says, flipping him off over his shoulder. Sungjong chooses that moment to look back, and Sungyeol chooses that moment to snag Sungjong\u2019s wrist. </p><p>\"Ahh, let go hyung,\" Sungjong whines, squirming away. </p><p>\"No way,\" Sungyeol says. He wraps an arm around Sungjong\u2019s neck. \"What do you say now?\" </p><p>Sungjong twists, smacking at Sungyeol\u2019s arm. \"I said I wanted pho, and I still do! You got to pick last time!\" </p><p>\"We could always go to that Thai place,\" Dongwoo suggests. He\u2019s laughing too, and Sungyeol does feel briefly ridiculous for chasing Sungjong down a public street\u2014but only until Sungjong takes the opportunity of Sungyeol glaring at Dongwoo to duck and flee. </p><p>Sungyeol crosses his arm and waits for the others to catch up. Sungjong sticks out his tongue at him, and Sungyeol makes a face back. </p><p>\"Won\u2019t it be busy?\" Myungsoo worries. </p><p>\"It\u2019s Friday night, everywhere\u2019s going to be busy,\" Sunggyu points out. He stops at the intersection. \"Alright, choose or I\u2019m choosing for you.\" </p><p>\"Fine, Thai,\" Sungyeol says quickly. \"I like that.\" </p><p>\"But\u2014\" Sungjong cuts himself off. </p><p>\"Then it\u2019s decided! Lead the way.\" </p><p>It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve all gotten together like this, seven people who got thrown together in university, ended up in the same city, and hung out too much together for their own good. Same programs, same dorms, mutual friends. Myungsoo inviting Woohyun to study with them, because Sungyeol knows him, however tangentially, and he must be smart, to have taught his class. (Woohyun had gotten roped in last minute, a last choice only available choice decision, but Sungyeol grudgingly has to admit he\u2019d done a good job.) Woohyun and Sunggyu weirdly close, Dongwoo in the same class, Howon his friend from the breakdancing club. Sungyeol\u2019s never sure how Sungjong happened\u2014Myungsoo, he thinks, or maybe Howon. (It was him, but Sungyeol tends to leave out the details.) The kid\u2019s in consulting, and gone half the time. They don\u2019t make sense, but relationships rarely make sense, a mix of fate and coincidences. </p><p>The restaurant is crowded when they get there, and Sungyeol is suddenly uncomfortably aware of Woohyun brushing against him\u2014they\u2019re all shoved together, waiting to be seated, jostling for space. It\u2019s too hot for this, and Sungyeol pushes away. Woohyun doesn\u2019t notice. </p><p>\"So what\u2019ve you been up to?\" Woohyun asks Myungsoo. They\u2019re settled at a long table towards the back. A breeze comes in from the open door to the outdoor seating area, and Sungyeol kind of wishes they could be there instead, since it\u2019s a nice late spring night.  </p><p>\"Work,\" Myungsoo says vaguely. He plays with his straw, and shrugs towards Sungyeol. Same stuff, he means. </p><p>\"He never tells me anything,\" Woohyun says, giving Sungyeol a snide look. </p><p>\"Why would I tell you anything?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Because you love me?\" Woohyun makes a heart with his hands. Sungyeol gags. </p><p>His chest feels like it\u2019s abut to explode. </p><p>He tunes Woohyun out for the rest of the night, opting instead to pick mercilessly on Sungjong. It\u2019s safer, and after an hour of what Myungsoo calls his insane cackle (he doesn\u2019t cackle), he\u2019s too high on elation to care. </p><p>They end up tumbling into Sunggyu and Woohyun\u2019s apartment, two blocks away, their doormat soon a mess of shoes. They\u2019d gone for drinks after, and there\u2019s a low buzz of energy flush against everyone\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"I hate horror movies,\" Sungjong moans. They arrange themselves on the couch and floor, Sunggyu hooking his laptop up to the TV. </p><p>\"No you don\u2019t,\" Myungsoo says at the same time Sungyeol says, \"you didn\u2019t have to come.\" </p><p>\"And miss out on seeing you scream like a baby?\" Sungjong says. \"No thanks.\" </p><p>Sungyeol tosses the remote at Sungjong\u2019s head\u2014his knee slams into the table instead. </p><p>\"Serves you right,\" Howon laughs, Sungyeol cursing his fate and Sungjong loudly in the same breath. </p><p>\"Ok, time to shut up,\" Sunggyu says. Someone squeezes in next to Sungyeol at the same time Sunggyu switches off the lights. </p><p>It\u2019s Woohyun, and he glances at Sungyeol as if daring him to say anything. Sungyeol jabs his elbow into his side. </p><p>The familiarity is almost disorienting, and for a moment, it feels like Sungyeol\u2019s nineteen again, and they\u2019re piled onto the ugly green couches in the dorm common room. Woohyun\u2019d been wedged between Sungyeol and the wooden arm. Their shoulders had touched, but by the end of the night, Woohyun was nearly on Sungyeol\u2019s lap, Sungyeol clutching at his shoulder and hiding behind his back. (He\u2019s not that scared, not like Myungsoo is hugging a pillow to his chest, but it\u2019s fun, and Sungyeol\u2019s always liked fun.) It\u2019s too easy to fall into the same patterns, because patterns are familiar, and patterns are easy. It\u2019s too easy to not think, not worry, to not hold the years of history between them that haven\u2019t always existed, to erase the months of skin hot against each other, and eyes that can\u2019t quite meet. It\u2019s too easy to ignore the voice that says don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, too easy to give into the one that tells him to be as selfish as he wants. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up with his head against Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, and Woohyun\u2019s hand resting lightly against his knee. He pulls away with a start. Woohyun draws away, his eyes never meeting his. Sungjong\u2019s clearly still awake, half hidden behind a pillow in front of them, but Myungsoo\u2019s dozed off leaning against the couch, and Dongwoo has too, even though it\u2019s barely midnight. It\u2019ll be hell to get them up again, Sungyeol thinks, but he knows Myungsoo\u2019s been pulling late nights to match their Asia offices. Maybe they were getting old. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up to Woohyun gently shaking his shoulder. </p><p>\"Everyone\u2019s staying the night,\" he says. \"Since no one has work tomorrow.\" </p><p>Sungyeol yawns, rubbing his eyes as he scans the room. </p><p>\"You're going to have to sleep in my room again, unless you want the kitchen.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019ll pass,\" Sungyeol says. He clambers over the back of the couch, and drags himself to Woohyun\u2019s room. Myungsoo\u2019s half on the couch even before Woohyun\u2019s pulled it out, and Howon\u2019s helping Sunggyu get spare blankets and sheets from his room.  </p><p>The sleeping bag\u2019s already laid out. Sungyeol eyes it, then pulls loose clothes out from Woohyun\u2019s drawers. </p><p>\"Not planning on sleeping naked?\" Woohyun asks as he walks in. </p><p>\"It\u2019s cold,\" Sungyeol says simply. </p><p>\"Suit yourself.\" </p><p>He reaches under the bedside table to monopolize Woohyun\u2019s charger like he always does, but his phone\u2019s in his bag, somewhere on the floor in the living room. </p><p>The blinds are open, and across the street, Sungyeol can see the shadows cast through lamp lit curtains. Motions of life flicker in and out of view, brief glimpses into anonymous lives. The buildings glow with the sheen of light that always clouds the city, billboards and office buildings and streetlights down below. Even up here, red flashes in the room, signatures of cars still awake and making their way through the streets. </p><p>The sleep haze slowly dissipates, and Sungyeol debates leaving, debates making his way to his own empty apartment. It\u2019s a long walk, but he doesn\u2019t mind walking. Nor is it cold. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>Woohyun comes in, pauses, hovering over Sungyeol hidden in the sleeping bag. </p><p>\"Already asleep?\" he asks. Sungyeol doesn\u2019t respond, doesn\u2019t move, and Woohyun steps carefully over him, and onto his bed. </p><p>Outside, there\u2019s the faint stirrings of someone shifting on the couch, the soft creaks of old furniture. Sungyeol traces the muted lines of his body with his eyes. The blanket is bunched in front of him, his shirt lifted just enough to expose a sliver of skin. Woohyun is nearly pressed up against the wall, and faint streaks of light cast across him through the still open blinds, breaking onto the empty side of the bed. </p><p>Outside, the lights in the apartment opposite turn off, but the lights of the city remain on. He\u2019s only ever seen them dark once\u2014a blackout, mid summer, and the first time he remembers seeing so many stars. </p><p>Woohyun is unmoving, and Sungyeol curls up a little tighter into himself. </p><p>A moment, a minute, an hour. </p><p>The mattress sinks under his knee as he climbs onto the bed. It\u2019s not cold, but Sungyeol tugs the blanket from Woohyun\u2019s grasp, and pulls it over the both of them. Woohyun stirs, but doesn\u2019t turn. </p><p>And Sungyeol sleeps, a transposition of Woohyun, a careful handspan apart.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The sleeping bag lies forgotten on the floor. Sungyeol leans over Woohyun on his bed, the dark light of a city night filtering in through the blinds. Woohyun\u2019s eyes are cautious, wary as he reaches up at Sungyeol, so Sungyeol grabs his fingers, brings them to his face and catches them in his mouth\u2014Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches, his eyes opening wide, mouth parting ever so slightly. It\u2019s enough\u2014Woohyun pulls Sungyeol down, only Sungyeol is already leaning down, kissing him. Woohyun\u2019s mouth is so hot and this is nothing like Sungyeol remembers, but it\u2019s been years and they\u2019re older and of course it\u2019s not. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s hands roam his body, and Sungyeol whines at the touch, whines for more, and Woohyun obliges. He\u2019s hot all over, Woohyun\u2019s tongue trapping his, and god, it feels so good the way he\u2019s using his mouth, the gentle pressure sending shockwaves right down to his crotch. Sungyeol lowers himself so he\u2019s lying on Woohyun, not propped on his elbows, and Woohyun immediately brings his arms around Sungyeol\u2019s body, and he\u2019s so warm and solid and Sungyeol grinds his thigh down between Woohyun\u2019s legs\u2014Woohyun whines in surprise, and Sungyeol does it again, and again, Woohyun\u2019s mouth still hot against his, until Woohyun\u2019s fingers clamp suddenly about him, and he muffles his cries against Sungyeol because Sunggyu is sleeping next door, and what Sungyeol would give to hear Woohyun moaning like that. </p><p>The thing is, Sungyeol doesn\u2019t like his roommates, and he\u2019s pretty sure they don\u2019t like him. It\u2019s far too easy to make excuses to stay overnight with Woohyun, and they\u2019re not even excuses, just reasons\u2014like every time Roommate #2  has his girlfriend over, or worse, when both #1 and #2 have their girlfriends over and they don\u2019t like each other very much and. </p><p>\"You need new roommates,\" Sunggyu tells him. </p><p>\"I need <i>no</i> roommates,\" Sungyeol grumbles, but this is convenient, ten minute walk to work\u2014five minutes to where Woohyun and Sunggyu live. </p><p>Pressed up against the far wall, Sungyeol with his back next to the window, and it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re some ten floors up because it\u2019d be so easy to glance in and see Woohyun sucking greedy kisses against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and Sungyeol has to bite on his own hand to keep quiet, because Woohyun\u2019s wrapped his hand around Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can last. But Woohyun lets go, palms Sungyeol\u2019s stomach. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t <i>stop</i>,\" Sungyeol says, but Woohyun places a finger against his lips. Wait, he means, and Sungyeol bites his tongue, because Woohyun\u2019s trailing kisses lower, and lower, and he\u2019s shuffled back until he\u2019s nearly on his stomach, and Sungyeol feels his own stomach drop. Not in a bad way, no, in a he\u2019s not sure if this is real and if this is too fast and then Woohyun\u2019s presses a kiss against Sungyeol\u2019s hip and: \"I won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want,\" Woohyun says, and his voice is soft and his eyes are uncertain and Sungyeol wonders why now, when he\u2019s usually a greater than life cloud of confidence\u2014Sungyeol pushes Woohyun\u2019s head down, and hopes that he\u2019ll take that as yes. Yes, he wants it. </p><p>\"I hope you\u2019re not moving in permanently,\" Sunggyu says. \"But you can stay if you do the laundry and the dishes.\" </p><p>\"What am I, Cinderella?\" Sungyeol snipes, and Woohyun has to stop him from killing Sunggyu when Sunggyu explains yes, and exactly why. </p><p>Third time\u2019s the charm, or something, and it\u2019s when Woohyun finally says, as they lie there in the morning sun: \"so\u2026is this a thing?\" </p><p>\"Do you want it to be a thing?\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"I\u2019m so tired I could die,\" Sungyeol whines. He throws himself onto the counter\u2014a passerby outside definitely gives him a strange look. Sungyeol wrinkles his nose at him.  </p><p>\"Hang in there,\" Myungsoo says. \"If you don\u2019t, then who\u2019s going to cause my early death from too much coffee consumption? That would be terrible, and you wouldn\u2019t want that to happen.\" </p><p>\"I liked it better when you didn\u2019t talk,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"When was that again? I don\u2019t remember that.\" Myungsoo laughs, leaning back on his stool. </p><p>The coffee shop is busy\u2014or rather, there\u2019s a herd of university kids, two tables pushed together, massive binders spread in front of them. They\u2019re loud enough that the music is a low buzz, and Sungyeol kind of wants to tell them to keep it down, but it\u2019s not so loud that it bothers them. Above it all, there\u2019s the voice of that talkative, cheerful barista with the cute smile. There\u2019s about two weeks before the big exam, and not even Sungyeol is that mean. Sungyeol had thought about it, briefly, but he\u2019s not that ambitious, not anymore\u2014he\u2019d taken the first round, passing by the edge of his teeth, but had never gotten around to doing the second. </p><p>\"Oh, someone on my team\u2019s taking level one too,\" Myungsoo says, when he notices that Sungyeol\u2019s attention has drifted. </p><p>\"Oh?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Yeah\u2014um, Joonmyun hyung, do you know him?\" </p><p>\"Joonmyun, Joonmyun\u2014hey, isn\u2019t he the computer guy?\" Sungyeol frowns. \"What\u2019s he doing that for?\" </p><p>Myungsoo shrugs. \"Why can\u2019t he?\" he says, then his eyes take on that amused glint. \"Maybe he\u2019s tired of dealing with all of us non engineers demanding silly things like explosions coming out of the buttons.\" </p><p>\"That was a joke!\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Well, his job still fills the work experience requirements,\" Myungsoo says. \"He probably knows as much about interest rates as much as the rest of us.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>Myungsoo suddenly sits up, and peers out the window. \"Isn\u2019t that Woohyun hyung?\" </p><p>Sungyeol whips about sharply, and sure enough, that\u2019s Woohyun walking down the street towards them. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll go see if\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, don\u2019t!\" Sungyeol pulls Myungsoo down, and it just happens that they\u2019re both facing the inside of the store, and not the store window. His heart doesn\u2019t seem to want to stop racing, and he swallows.  </p><p>\"Why?\" Myungsoo asks, his brows creased into a frown, but he doesn\u2019t get up or turn until a good half minute has passed, and they\u2019re both sure that Woohyun\u2019s walked past. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to deal with his obnoxious attitude right now,\" Sungyeol says. His coffee\u2019s almost gone, and he looks mournfully at the bottom of the cup. Maybe he\u2019ll get a refill. That\u2019d make it six for the day\u2014pushing it even for him. </p><p>\"What\u2019s been up between you two lately, anyway?\" Myungsoo says. </p><p>\"Nothing?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Hmmm,\" Myungsoo hums. He traces patterns onto the glass in front of them, and if it\u2019d been winter instead of early summer, Sungyeol wonders what he\u2019d be drawing. As it is, it\u2019s nonsensical and invisible and Myungsoo\u2019s mind seems to be absolutely elsewhere. </p><p>Sungyeol sighs and pushes his chair back. He could really do with another cup. The guy at the register has almost the same dazed off expression as Myungsoo, and Sungyeol snorts, hastily disguising it as a cough. Almost immediately, the smile\u2019s back, dimple and all, and Sungyeol really wonders how he does it. Sungyeol definitely couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\"Oi, still here?\" Sungyeol prods Myungsoo as he sits back down, hot coffee joining his empty cup. </p><p>\"You make good friends,\" Myungsoo says abruptly. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s eyebrows shoot up.  </p><p>\"<i>What</i>?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m just saying you make good friends,\" Myungsoo says, and Sungyeol suddenly realises he\u2019s talking about Woohyun, and his chest clenches. It\u2019d been Myungsoo that time, too, pointing out Woohyun across the street, a year after they\u2019d graduated. He\u2019d been surrounded by people, but Woohyun had caught his eye, and it\u2019s a story that\u2019s been unpaused. They hadn\u2019t been that close in university, anyway, and then Woohyun had graduated, moved on with his adult job and his adult life, while Sungyeol was still buried in exams. Myungsoo\u2019s gone back to staring out the window. \"Even if you weren\u2019t always friends.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s an understatement,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Alright, even if you used to hate his guts,\" Myungsoo says, and he\u2019s laughing without laughing, eyes crinkled, mouth stretched in a barely contained smile. </p><p>\"I did <i>not</i>!\" </p><p>\"Oh? If only I\u2019d recorded it somewhere,\" Myungsoo says, slowly reaching for his phone. \"Hm, can you send videos in text messages? I bet hyung would love to\u2014\" </p><p>\"Myungsoo, you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\" Sungyeol lunges for his phone, and his coffee wavers dangerously. </p><p>\"By the way,\" Myungsoo says, as they\u2019re on the way out, and he nods towards the kids still bent over their books. \"Are you ever going to take Level Two?\" </p><p>\"Nah, I\u2019m good,\" Sungyeol says. \"Besides\u2014never mind.\" </p><p>Besides, he\u2019s always been a little afraid of failure. (It\u2019s just never stopped him from trying.)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol is jittery with coffee, fifth cup of the day. It\u2019s seven in the evening, and he knows he won\u2019t be sleeping early tonight. It\u2019s a wet autumn, and rain falls against the window as he sits at the counter. People pass by, umbrellas and jackets, steps hurried, no wish to linger. A group of kids crowd into the poutine store across the street, and there\u2019s no one sitting outside the Starbucks next to it, and he doesn\u2019t blame them. </p><p>Someone slides into the seat beside him, and slides his hand over his. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll be back,\" Woohyun says. He sheds his wet coat and hangs it over the back of the chair. There\u2019s a lull, or maybe it\u2019s just the end of the day, and there\u2019s no one in line when Woohyun steps up to the counter. He says something that makes the girl there laugh, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers are still tapping restlessly against the table. </p><p>\"Did you want dinner after this? Chicken?\" Woohyun asks. He pushes back the chair, resting his apple cider onto the counter. </p><p>\"Maybe,\" Sungyeol says. He chews at the rim of the cup, as Woohyun takes the lid off his, stirring his cider with the cinnamon stick. </p><p>\"How many?\" Woohyun asks. He means the coffee. </p><p>\"Five,\" Sungyeol admits. It\u2019s bad for you, Woohyun is going to say, but he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>\"We could see a movie,\" Woohyun says. \"Or go to the mall.\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s fine.\" </p><p>\"Where\u2019s Myungsoo?\" he asks. </p><p>\"I dunno, probably at home.\" </p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then\u2014 </p><p>\"You\u2019re not mad at me?\" </p><p>Woohyun glances sharply at him, before his eyes flicker back to the street outside. \"Why would I be?\" he says. </p><p>\"Because I\u2014\" Sungyeol shakes his head. \"Never mind.\" </p><p>\"I would like it if you talked to me,\" Woohyun says wryly, and Sungyeol knows that Woohyun knows what he means. It\u2019s been weeks, and they\u2019ve seen each other since then, but Sungyeol\u2019s never had the nerve to ask. </p><p>\"I <i>do</i> talk to you,\" Sungyeol says petulantly. \"I\u2019m talking to you right now.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, I got that far,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>He\u2019s wearing a neat button down shirt, the sleeves a little damp where they rest on the table. Sungyeol is too, because it\u2019s the middle of the week, and anyway, unlike Woohyun, there is no casual Friday at work. </p><p>\"Do you want to come over?\" Woohyun says, and yes, that\u2019s exactly what Sungyeol wants. Sungyeol\u2019s place is closest, but that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s get drinks,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Okay,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol wishes he\u2019d ask again, wishes that he\u2019d say no, let\u2019s not go get drinks, let\u2019s not go to a movie, let\u2019s not get dinner. </p><p>But Woohyun doesn\u2019t, because unlike Sungyeol, Woohyun may be smug and insufferable, but he isn\u2019t a dick. </p><p>And Woohyun, like Myungsoo, doesn\u2019t push him unless necessary, but Myungsoo has never pulled him rain-drenched through the doorway of a dark apartment, and kissed him, water dripping down their hair, skirting their parted lips.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The weather swings between the lingering remains of summer, and the wet cold of the imminent winter. It\u2019s late, the end of the week, he\u2019s tired, and he wants to go home. Today\u2019s one of those cold days, and it\u2019s an easy choice to turn his steps towards the subway station, instead of the meandering forty something minutes walk home. It\u2019s fall, and the sun sets too early. His desk was lit by pale fluorescence, and the orange glow of the ending day is something he hasn\u2019t seen in a while. </p><p>The trees were already bare, skeletons awaiting the bitter wash of ice. Leaves have long been swept away from the gutters, and the lengthened nights already seem to be taking their toll on the city, people hurting down streets, hands in pockets, faces hidden in scarves. </p><p>Sungyeol walks, hunched into himself, the wind at his back. He pauses to stuff a twenty into a cup, the woman huddled into the recess between two buildings calling out a thank you he\u2019s too tired to acknowledge. The subway\u2019s far from empty, but it\u2019s also far from full, and Sungyeol stares blankly at an ad he\u2019s seen hundreds of times before, hand wrapped around a pole, nearly missing his stop. </p><p>He\u2019s just missed the bus, and the next one doesn\u2019t come for fifteen minutes, the same amount of time it takes to walk. </p><p>\"Hey.\" </p><p>It\u2019s Woohyun\u2019s voice, and for a moment, Sungyeol contemplates ignoring it. </p><p>\"What are you doing down here?\" Sungyeol asks. He turns, and sure enough, it\u2019s Woohyun, walking down towards the subway. </p><p>Woohyun shrugs, gesturing vaguely. \"Have you eaten yet?\" he asks. He nods towards the main street, where he\u2019s just come from, and where late night places are still open. </p><p>\"You know I haven\u2019t.\" Sungyeol\u2019s brows rise. </p><p>\"Me neither,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s lying. \"Let\u2019s grab dinner.\" </p><p>\"Only if you\u2019re paying,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Sure,\" Woohyun says. It almost catches Sungyeol by surprise. </p><p>It\u2019s not the first time Woohyun\u2019s agreed to Sungyeol\u2019s demands, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s agreed so readily. </p><p>It\u2019s become too easy to see each other, to say 'let\u2019s grab dinner, and usually it\u2019s Woohyun who says 'want to come over?' because they usually meet in his neck of the woods. It\u2019s easier than unexpected detours on his way home, to walking faster when he catches sight of a familiar shadow. Sometimes he stays the night, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t. Sometimes it feels like everything\u2019s gone back to normal. He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s a normal he remembers very well.  </p><p>Their conversation is muted and spare, over fried chicken and beer. The girls at the table behind Woohyun eagerly fill their silence. Friday means a busier crowd, even though it\u2019s already past nine. The karaoke place across the street\u2019s open for another six hours, and it\u2019ll probably be full for most of them. Sungyeol asks about his work, and Woohyun answers in words Sungyeol knows, but in sentences that completely elude his grasp. His eyes keep swinging to the TV in the back corner, where an old music show is playing </p><p>\"You know the saying, when it rains, it pours?\" Woohyun says suddenly. </p><p>Sungyeol wrenches back his attention. There\u2019s a faint crease between Woohyun\u2019s brows, and no hint of a smile, forced or real, in the lines of his face. </p><p>\"It hasn\u2019t rained lately,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun wraps his hands around his beer. \"But when it does,\" he says. \"Never mind. You normally don\u2019t work this late.\" </p><p>\"How would you know?\" Sungyeol says, but Woohyun raises an eyebrow\u2014of course he knows\u2014and Sungyeol shrugs instead. </p><p>\"Crunch time,\" he says. \"End of quarter reports are due.\" </p><p>\"Seems like they\u2019re always due.\" </p><p>\"They\u2019re more due than usual.\" </p><p>\"Hmm.\" </p><p>Woohyun reaches for the bill, as promised, but Sungyeol pulls it away, replacing Woohyun's bills with his own, before pushing it to the ahjumma at the cashier. </p><p>\"I thought,\" Woohyun begins to say, but leaves that thought unfinished as Sungyeol thanks her for their change, sliding it all back anyway. </p><p>\"Come over,\" Sungyeol says suddenly. </p><p>Woohyun freezes, then frowns. </p><p>\"I\u2019m always at your place,\" Sungyeol says.  </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s palms are suddenly too warm, and he shoves them into the pockets of his jacket as he shoulders his way out the door. Months have passed since Woohyun\u2019s last been over\u2014Sungyeol has nearly become a regular in his apartment instead. </p><p>\"It\u2019s late,\" he adds. For a moment, he hears it in Woohyun\u2019s voice. </p><p>What the fuck, his mind says, but Sungyeol has always been good at heeding advice. </p><p>\"Alright,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t know what answer he\u2019d been hoping for. He nods down the street, darker, emptier, the one that leads to where Sungyeol lives. \"Lead the way.\" </p><p>They slip into his apartment, quiet, some of his neighbours\u2019 windows already dark. Sungyeol kicks off his shoes into the corner, and drags a still hesitant Woohyun in through the door. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t be a stranger,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t think I ever was.\" </p><p>There\u2019s that old example\u2014a coffee mug is the same as a donut, a ball, the same as a ball. All it takes is a little push and pull, just enough force, a continuous deformation until it\u2019s gone from one state to the other, from the other back to the first, each belonging to the same equivalence class. But break a donut into two halves, and each is the same as a ball. Pinch two donuts into one, and infinity stretches into an impossible bottle, into the shapings of a heart. </p><p>Hands rough against skin, lips crashing into teeth, two bodies tumbling onto the couch, twisted, tangled. Sungyeol clutches at Woohyun\u2019s shirt, while Woohyun\u2019s hands play against the ridges of his spine. Familiar and unfamiliar, too long, too long, too long. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s mouth sucks teasing, hot and wet against his, and Sungyeol moans openly, pressing himself against Woohyun, Woohyun grinding up against him just as eagerly. He\u2019s dizzy, head spinning\u2014he pushes Woohyun against the wall, pulls away just long enough for Woohyun to look up, lips parted, shiny, swollen, before Sungyeol leans in, teeth closing around Woohyun\u2019s lower lip. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s fingers dig into the back of his neck; Sungyeol couldn\u2019t have pulled away even if he wanted to, but he doesn\u2019t, he wants Woohyun writhing under him like this, hips pushing upwards, only Sungyeol is half kneeling on his thigh and Woohyun\u2019s desperation clear in the way he has Sungyeol kiss him instead. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s cheeks are flushed, his chest rising and falling, eyes fixed on Sungyeol. </p><p>Such a bad idea\u2014it flits through his mind, but then Woohyun\u2019s tongue flickers at Sungyeol\u2019s fingers that\u2019d been tracing the line of Woohyun\u2019s jaw. </p><p>Sungyeol lets him, lets his tongue circle his finger, hot and wet, as he presses it against the corner of his mouth. Woohyun\u2019s eyes promise so much more. Hot, wet, and tight, and when Woohyun leans forward, catching him between his lips, pressing him between his tongue and the roof of his mouth. Sungyeol shifts until he\u2019s straddling Woohyun; his eyes have fallen shut, but he opens them, shoves in, deep, so he can watch Woohyun gag, the moment of surprise, but not for long, as Sungyeol imagines the hot heat of Woohyun\u2019s tongue swirling around his dick, of his swollen red lips, of Woohyun looking up at him like that, from between his legs. </p><p>With a wet pop, Sungyeol pulls away. </p><p>\"I\u2019m\u2026\" His voice is rough and hoarse. He swallows, wetting his throat. </p><p>Whatever words follow flee his mind as soon as they form. He wipes his hand against his pants, and turn away. </p><p>\"You can shower first,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Yeah, okay.\" The couch creaks as Woohyun stands. He pauses, briefly, a step behind and a step to the left, before he walks past Sungyeol and into the bathroom. </p><p>There\u2019s a spare towel in the drawer, and Woohyun knows where it is. </p><p>The couch sinks under Sungyeol\u2019s weight, as he drops himself onto it, again. The table\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s been a mess for well over a week. His skin\u2019s on fire and his clothes confining, but he doesn\u2019t trust himself to move, to touch, not right now. The sound of rushing water stops, and a few minutes later, Woohyun walks out, hair damp, towel tied around his waist. </p><p>\"Same place as usual,\" Sungyeol says. Spare set of clothes, he means. Woohyun knows, this isn\u2019t an unfamiliar tableau, just one that hasn\u2019t been visited in a while. </p><p>Sungyeol rubs his eyes, then takes his turn in the shower, the water running hot against his skin until it prickles from the scalding temperature, instead of his burning nerves. </p><p>\"Your bed,\" Woohyun says, as Sungyeol goes into his room. He\u2019s sitting at Sungyeol\u2019s desk, staring at it. </p><p>\"What about it?\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s so\u2026neat,\" he says. </p><p>Sungyeol snorts. \"Take it,\" he says. He tosses his clothes into the laundry bin, toweling his hair as he walks back out. </p><p>\"Hey, Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"I told you, it\u2019s crunch period,\" Sungyeol says. Papers are scattered across the table, and Sungyeol pulls his laptop out, powering it on. Woohyun had trailed out after him, his presence awkward in the space between Sungyeol\u2019s room, and Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I\u2019ve been sleeping out here anyway,\" Sungyeol says. It wasn\u2019t, at least, a lie. </p><p>His eyes are fixed on the screen, even as he keeps note of Woohyun, finally turning around. </p><p>\"Good night,\" Woohyun says softly. </p><p>\"Mmmm.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol wakes to the ache of an empty apartment, but when he pads across the room, his bed is still occupied. Softly, he returns to the kitchen, methodically pouring beans into the grinder, turning the handle until they\u2019re not too fine, just coarse enough for the coffee to steep well. The electric kettle\u2019s been filled and turned on, and Sungyeol grabs two mugs from the shelf. He stares at them for a moment, then returns one, replacing it with a mug on the shelf above, shoved all the way to the back. </p><p>Footsteps sound behind him, and Sungyeol pours the ground coffee into the bottom of the french press, fingers tapping against the counter as he waits for the water to boil. </p><p>\"There\u2019s cereal,\" Sungyeol says. \"That\u2019s it.\" </p><p>\"And coffee.\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s voice is still rough with sleep, and it skips across Sungyeol like a live wire. </p><p>\"I always have coffee,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun chuckles, taking a step closer, and then another, until he\u2019s leaning against the counter besides Sungyeol, arms over his chest. \"You ran out once,\" he says. </p><p>\"Ugh, don\u2019t bring it up.\" </p><p>\"It wasn\u2019t pleasant for me either!\" Woohyun\u2019s quick to point out. </p><p>Sungyeol scowls in irritation, although there\u2019s no one to see it but the kettle, as he slowly pours the water into the french press. \"You\u2019re still mad I sent you out for more?\" </p><p>\"Of course not,\" Woohyun laughs, eyes scrunched, grin wide. </p><p>Sungyeol turns back to the coffee. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not petty like you,\" Woohyun adds. </p><p>\"You\u2019re lucky I like my coffee more than I like you,\" Sungyeol growls. </p><p>\"Ouch,\" Woohyun says. He reaches across the counter, over Sungyeol. Sungyeol pulls back and turns towards the fridge, but Woohyun only grabs two bowls from the drying rack, and Sungyeol grabs the milk. Woohyun doesn\u2019t wait, just pours himself a bowl of Lucky Charms, and takes the milk from Sungyeol. </p><p>\"You really need to do groceries,\" Woohyun comments. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t feel like it,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs, checking the time on the stove. \"I never eat here anyway.\" </p><p>\"Not even breakfast?\" </p><p>\"Especially not breakfast.\" </p><p>\"Fair enough,\" Woohyun says. The spoons are in the drawer in front of Sungyeol, and Sungyeol takes a step back when Woohyun reaches for it. </p><p>The thing about patterns was that patterns were easy, and patterns were familiar. Patterns were automatic, patterns mean that they don\u2019t have to think. Patterns mean that they move around each other in ways they always have, or once had. Like gears that\u2019ve fallen out of use, stiff and skipping and scraping and ungreased, but still, they click against each other, turning, turning, turning. </p><p>\"Doing anything today?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>Sungyeol glances up from his coffee. \"Just work,\" he says. \"I\u2019m busy.\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s eyes are focussed on him in consideration. \"You need a break,\" he says. </p><p>\"You\u2019re not my mom,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Good, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got that sorted out.\" </p><p>Sungyeol puts the mug down, tracing the handle with a finger, down the plain lines that encircle its wide rim. \"What\u2019d you have in mind?\" </p><p>\"You could do your groceries,\" Woohyun suggests. His eyes are laughing and Sungyeol kicks his ankle. </p><p>\"The mall? A movie? Take a walk in the park?\" </p><p>\"What park?\" Sungyeol asks, and then: \"are you paying?\" </p><p>\"For your groceries? Keep dreaming.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re the one who wants to see a movie,\" Sungyeol says, even though that hadn\u2019t been what Woohyun had said at all. </p><p>\"You\u2019re asking me to take you out on a date?\" Woohyun asks.  </p><p>\"I should do groceries,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s go shopping,\" Woohyun says. \"And get groceries on the way back.\" </p><p>\"<i>Let\u2019s</i>?\" Sungyeol says. \"I don\u2019t seem to recall saying I wanted your company.\" </p><p>\"You always want my company,\" Woohyun says flippantly. \"You know you miss it.\" </p><p>\"Gross.\" Sungyeol gags. </p><p>\"So is that a yes or no?\" </p><p>\"I guess I\u2019ll let you borrow my clothes,\" Sungyeol says, and he supposes that it's  answer enough.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The wind, when they venture outside several hours later, is bitter and cold, and Sungyeol regrets it almost immediately. Woohyun\u2019s huddled into his coat as well, hands in his pockets, wind whipping his hair into his face. It\u2019s a soft brown, and Sungyeol wonders when he\u2019d changed it. </p><p>\"It\u2019s cold, isn\u2019t it?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Obviously,\" Sungyeol snaps. </p><p>\"Maybe we should\u2019ve checked the weather,\" Woohyun says. There\u2019s a crease between his brows. </p><p>\"That would\u2019ve been too smart for you,\" Sungyeol says. He conveniently forgets that he hadn\u2019t either\u2014it hadn\u2019t been his idea to go outside, would be what he\u2019d say if Woohyun pointed it out. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t point it out. </p><p>The day was bright, the sun piercing, its warmth shattered by the wind. It\u2019s late October, but winter\u2019s started earlier than that before, and maybe this was going to be one of those years. It\u2019d been in the mid twenties last week, but the weather one day is no guarantee of the season the next. A softball game is underway down the hill in the park, a mix of kids and teens. An old man is walking his dog across the street, the pit mix trotting ahead of him, then turning back, matching his pace. Sensing danger, a fluffy white cat darts under a parked car, their tail visible, swishing back and forth in irritation. </p><p>By the time they hit the main street, Sungyeol\u2019s ears are cold, and Woohyun\u2019s cheeks are pink. </p><p>\"I know where we should go first,\" Woohyun says. He rubs his hands together, then grabs Sungyeol\u2019s wrist and tugs him across the side street. </p><p>\"I can cross the street by myself!\" Sungyeol yanks his hand back. \"There aren\u2019t even any cars!\" </p><p>\"Children should always hold an adult\u2019s hand when crossing streets,\" Woohyun says, laughing. He runs off before Sungyeol can hit him, dodging a large group of teenagers who give them dirty looks. Woohyun doesn't get very far, and Sungyeol hooks an arm about Woohyun\u2019s neck. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not even shorter than you!\" Sungyeol says.  </p><p>\"Height has nothing to do with age,\" Woohyun says, ruffling Sungyeol\u2019s hair. </p><p>Sungyeol rolls his eyes and lets go. He could be an adult, thanks very much. </p><p>They walk down the familiar street, past the place they\u2019d eaten last night. Despite the chill, it's still busy, groups of friends pushing past each other. A heavy mix of English and Korean and Chinese threads down the street, weaving in and out and skipping across and over, as people pass people, little clusters of private lives. Sungyeol buries his hands deeper into his pockets, wondering where Woohyun has in mind. Well, there\u2019s only a few places, really, stationary shops and the like. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s go in,\" Woohyun says\u2014before Sungyeol could protest, he\u2019d grabbed his wrist again, and was pulling him into a store, colourful bags arranged in the window. </p><p>An old Girl\u2019s Generation song is playing, and without the wind, the warmth inside is immediate. It\u2019s small, narrow, full of accessories. Sungyeol\u2019s stopped by before, helping Myungsoo pick something out for his at the time girlfriend. The owner greets them from the register, and Woohyun waves back cheerfully. There\u2019s an arrangement of ties next to the counter, but Woohyun has gone around the center aisle of bags, heading towards the back of the shop. </p><p>\"Why here?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Because it\u2019s cold!\" he says. Woohyun hums, running his hand in the air over a row of scarves. Ah, because it's cold. </p><p>\"This would look cute on you,\" Woohyun says. He drapes it around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, Sungyeol too stunned to stop him, then pushes Sungyeol in front of the mirror. \"See, I knew it.\" </p><p>Woohyun is peering at his reflection over Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, over the bright red scarf looped loosely over his shoulder. Sungyeol grudgingly admits the scarf looks nice, and tells himself it\u2019s not because Woohyun had picked it out. </p><p>\"It\u2019s a scarf,\" Sungyeol says flatly. </p><p>\"I know it\u2019s a scarf,\" Woohyun says. He doesn't wait for Sungyeol to reply, and before Sungyeol has a chance to protest, Woohyun's paid for it and was tugging Sungyeol out of the store again. </p><p>Sungyeol pulls away as soon as they step outside. </p><p>\"What is <i>wrong</i> with you?\" he says. \"You\u2019re acting all\u2026\" he trails off, not quite able to find the words he needs. Familiar. Like they\u2019re more than friends. But that\u2019s all they are. </p><p>\"You need a break,\" Woohyun says again. </p><p>\"Yeah, whatever, but what the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\" Sungyeol ignores the looks directed towards them. </p><p>\"Nothing,\" Woohyun says. \"I just wanted to\u2026look, we don\u2019t need to fight about everything, alright?\" </p><p>\"We\u2019re not <i>fighting</i>,\" Sungyeol says. He shakes his head and shoves his hands in his pockets, burying his face deeper into the scarf. \"Let\u2019s go get coffee.\" </p><p>They get coffee, and then they get snacks at the grocery store, the red bean fish cakes quickly cooling in the wind outside. Woohyun drags him to look at the newest girl group CDs, and Sungyeol decides that yeah, he wants to see a movie after all. They take the subway down, Woohyun picking the new superhero movie, paying for their tickets like Sungyeol had demanded. Sungyeol buys the popcorn, and the movie's not great, but it\u2019s not terrible either. The mall is packed, and there\u2019s not much point hanging around. They meander down the street anyway, just long enough for Woohyun\u2019s cheeks to flush pink again, and this time, Sungyeol shoves Woohyun into a store, and picks a random scarf out from a shelf. It's worth it, to see Woohyun\u2019s look of surprise. The sun is quickly falling below the horizon, and they end up riding the subway back up. Not chicken, though, opting instead for a different place they used to frequent. Either Woohyun suggests it, or Sungyeol does, but they end up pushing into the karaoke place, flush with two bottles of soju, Sungyeol singing girl group songs half tone deaf, Woohyun crooning ballads of lost love. Sungyeol drops onto the couch next to Woohyun, and Woohyun\u2019s hand brushes against his shoulder. </p><p>It's a flush that carries them down the street, and back to Sungyeol\u2019s apartment, and it's too late for Woohyun to leave, Sungyeol says. By the time Sungyeol's out of the shower, Woohyun's already in bed\u2014Sungyeol glances at the couch in the living room. He pushes Woohyun to the other side of the bed, and slides under the covers, instead. </p><p>Summer had passed and winter hadn\u2019t yet come, and the heat from their bodies mingle beneath the blanket, covering them both. Woohyun's lying on his back, and Sungyeol on his side, eyes tracing the shadow of Woohyun\u2019s profile. The light\u2019s off, but the city's never entirely dark, and it's through the not quite opaque blinds that Sungyeol sees the wealth of people\u2019s lives reflected in Woohyun\u2019s still open eyes. </p><p>They stare up, towards the ceiling, until, perhaps sensing Sungyeol\u2019s scrutiny, fall shut. Sungyeol too, lets his eyelids fall. </p><p>They are a handspan apart, and a hand brushes against his. Their fingers tangle briefly together, before he pulls away. The buzz from before hasn't quite left, and as they lie there, Sungyeol truly understand what it means to tremble with need. Mouth, hot against his skin; fingers ghosting down the line of his neck; hand clasped about his wrist, hand pressed against his shoulder, hand running down his thigh. </p><p>They\u2019re so close, and he knows that if he just reaches out, a finger\u2019s width, if he just reaches out and curls his fingers about his, then maybe\u2026Then maybe. </p><p>He wills his eyes shut again, rolls onto his back, tries to pretend that he\u2019s not lying in bed next to a man who he\u2019d very much like to kiss, a man who he\u2019d very much like to kiss him, to hold him down, to suck at his skin with lips and teeth all hot and wet and leave him with so little control of himself. Tries to pretend that they hadn\u2019t, twenty four hours ago, done nearly the same thing\u2014but he\u2019s the one who\u2019d pulled away, the one to step away, because they can\u2019t, because they shouldn\u2019t\u2014because he\u2019s greedy, and he wants more. </p><p>Their fingers touch again, and they are neither of them asleep. </p><p>Woohyun brushes his finger across the inside of Sungyeol\u2019s wrist, a shuddering breath running down the lines of his body. Carefully, he traces it upwards, circling the back of his thumb, letting his hand slide up Sungyeol\u2019s arm. Sungyeol doesn\u2019t move, as if frozen, the only indication a faint tremor as his breath sticks in his lungs. His hand pauses, just below Sungyeol\u2019s elbow, as if afraid to go any further, as if saying that they could stop, that all he had to do was roll over, to roll away, and none of this would\u2019ve happened. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t, and so he continues to feel the minute ridges of skin against skin, until it comes to rest on his shoulder, the same shoulder that a few hours earlier, he\u2019d just as barely dared to place his hand on. </p><p>He\u2019d still yet to move, so he traces his fingers against his neck, along his collar bones, settling in the hollow of his throat. His pulse beats loud, and he can\u2019t be sure how much of that is his own, running through his veins, pounding against every inch of his skin. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t dare move closer, yet he also can\u2019t bear to draw away, and so his touch lingers, five beats, six, ten, twenty. Twenty one, twenty two\u2014too long, but he\u2019s barely withdrawn when thin fingers wrap around his wrist, and Sungyeol\u2019s pulled him onto his side. </p><p>\"Are\u2026\" Woohyun begins to say, but it\u2019s swallowed as Sungyeol props himself up on one elbow. He leans in close, his breath skimming Woohyun\u2019s skin. Fingers trace his wrist, and then Sungyeol\u2019s rolled on top of him, his weight heavy, reassuring. His hand brushes against his face, Sungyeol holding himself up just enough for Woohyun to see the light glint off his eyes, and then he\u2019s too close, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t think, just clutches him against him, fingers tangling in his hair, kissing him, being kissed. Sungyeol\u2019s hand cups the side of his face, and Woohyun\u2019s hand slips beneath Sungyeol\u2019s tank, riding up his back, until it comes to rest between his shoulder bones. Sungyeol\u2019s leg is beneath Woohyun\u2019s and Woohyun\u2019s leg is between Sungyeol\u2019s, Sungyeol grinding against him, small sounds slipping into Woohyun\u2019s mouth. God, his mouth was so hot, and Woohyun lets Sungyeol do the work, lets Sungyeol take control, lets Sungyeol draw back just enough for Woohyun to see the want glowing in his eyes, then let Sungyeol catches his lip between his, because there\u2019s a need in Sungyeol that Woohyun\u2019s missed, that Woohyun\u2019s craved and had forgotten and it\u2019s almost like the first time.  </p><p>His hand traces the ridges of Sungyeol\u2019s spine, following the line of his body to the hollow of his  hip, and Sungyeol\u2019s breath hitches, even as he continues kissing Woohyun, Woohyun heady and breathless. </p><p>A small moan, and Woohyun takes that for encouragement, takes Sungyeol grinding against him as encouragement, and slips his hand beneath the elastic of his waistband, circling Sungyeol\u2019s cock. He\u2019s hard, so hard, he\u2019d felt it against him and it takes so little, Sungyeol biting down against him, loud, like in everything else he does. Woohyun catches these sounds in his mouth and rolls him over, still rubbing circles against the head of his cock, pressing him into the mattress, until Sungyeol comes, one long drawn out whine, and Woohyun, taking that sound deep into him, letting it pool at the base of his stomach, grinds against Sungyeol\u2019s leg, until he feels the tension explode and escape and suffuse his skin and his nerves and for long moments, all he feels is Sungyeol, Sungyeol, Sungyeol\u2014 </p><p>He pulls away, chest rising and falling, breathing hard. His head is spinning, his mind cloudy, his limbs not quite his own. There\u2019s a sense of familiarity buried deep inside him, mixed with the sense of something he can\u2019t quite touch. And then there\u2019s Sungyeol, a handspan apart, and out of the corner of his eye, he sees his face, flushed, hair plastered against the side, slick with sweat. His eyes are turned steadfastly upwards, and Woohyun, for a moment, thinks about running his hand through Sungyeol\u2019s hair. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though. </p><p>Hot, sweaty, sticky, he drifts off to sleep, and Sungyeol is beside him.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He wakes early, slips out from under the covers, careful not to wake the other. </p><p>The sun hasn't quite risen, because it\u2019s late in the season. He closes the door behind him, and then the door to the bathroom, as he rinses last night off his skin, sloughing away beneath the hot stream of water. </p><p>He towels himself dry, and his hair, and then he goes back into the room where Sungyeol is still asleep, picking up from the floor the clothes he\u2019d worn to work, where he\u2019d left it two nights ago. He dresses, and Sungyeol still does not wake, because the sun hasn\u2019t quite made its slow way into the world. </p><p>He could, Woohyun thinks, leave now. He could leave a note, or nothing at all and just slip away, and they could both go back to pretending that last night, and the night before, moments of indiscretion, could be wiped from both their memories as if they\u2019d never existed. He doesn\u2019t want to, but he could. </p><p>He doesn't. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s fridge isn\u2019t quite empty\u2014milk, a beer, a half empty jar of kimchi, two eggs in the door. </p><p>This might\u2019ve been Sungyeol\u2019s apartment, but Woohyun was no stranger. </p><p>Humming quietly to himself, he pulls bowls and chopsticks from the cabinets, the drawers, and raids what little is in Sungyeol\u2019s fridge. The motions are near automatic, something akin to memory. He\u2019ll make coffee later, when Sungyeol is awake. </p><p>\"What are you doing?\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart leaps, and when he turns, Sungyeol is leaning against the wall, eyes staring sleepily at him. He\u2019s always been handsome, and even now, half awake, Woohyun feels attraction stir inside of him. He forces his heart down, and forces a grin onto his face. </p><p>It\u2019s not that hard, because it\u2019s Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Making breakfast, obviously,\" he says. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s eyes flicker across the kitchen, and Woohyun turns back to the stove, testing the edge of the pancake. Bubbles are beginning to form on the batter, but if he flips it too soon, it\u2019ll break. </p><p>\"Who asked you to do that?\" And Sungyeol\u2019s voice is curt and short and he moves past Woohyun, his presence fleeting. He grabs the dishcloth as he does, to clean up the mess on the counter Woohyun had meant to clean. </p><p>\"Well look who\u2019s a ray of sunshine,\" Woohyun says. Maybe he should\u2019ve left. Maybe he should\u2019ve waited for Sungyeol to get up first. Maybe, last night, he shouldn\u2019t have wanted. </p><p>He\u2019s forgotten how volatile Sungyeol can be, at times. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll make coffee,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun swallows back the 'I was going to get to that,' he wants to say. </p><p>\"Alright,\" he says instead. </p><p>Sungyeol sets the kettle on, and Woohyun watches him out of the corner of his eyes. He hasn\u2019t changed, his arms thin and pale and bare, his hair a mess, and he knows this is a picture that few other\u2019s have seen. That only Woohyun\u2019s seen. He swallows the thought down, and turns back to the stove. </p><p>\"And why pancakes? We could\u2019ve just had cereal again, I don\u2019t\u2014\" </p><p>\"<i>You</i> can have cereal again if you don\u2019t want it,\" Woohyun cuts him off. This is the last one, and he turns the heat off the stove, checking underneath to make sure it\u2019s done. </p><p>\"God, this makes it feel like we\u2019re boyfriends or something,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart had leapt, and now it plummets, but he\u2019ll be damned if he lets it show. He\u2019s never sure if Sungyeol does it on purpose, or if he does it without thinking, or if he can\u2019t tell the difference himself. </p><p>The smell of coffee replaces conversation. Woohyun stares at some point behind Sungyeol\u2019s head, while Sungyeol stares down at his own plate, or maybe Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>They weren\u2019t, of course. Boyfriends. I get it, Woohyun had told him. We\u2019re just friends.  </p><p>But last night, for a brief moment, he\u2019d thought they could be, again. </p><p>Sungyeol doesn\u2019t think that. </p><p>Sungyeol kicks him under the table, and Woohyun looks up to see Sungyeol\u2019s scowl. </p><p>\"What was that for?\" </p><p>\"For being annoying,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Wow, look who\u2019s talking.\" Woohyun scoffs and rolls his eyes, and lets the usual bickering carry them through. He kicks Sungyeol back, but changes his mind\u2014he slides his foot up Sungyeol\u2019s shin, watches him, warily, watches his expression flicker to surprise, before schooling back into neutrality. Sungyeol jerks away, and his face disappears behind his mug. </p><p>\"I\u2019d better get going.\" His chair scrapes back loudly as he stands. It grates, and he really should\u2019ve just left before Sungyeol had awoken. Maybe that\u2019s what Sungyeol had meant, what are you doing, he hadn\u2019t meant the pancakes. He grins at Sungyeol, tapping at his empty plate. \"I cooked, so you get the dishes.\" </p><p>Sungyeol wrinkles his nose in discontent. </p><p>\"I knew I\u2019d be cleaning up your mess,\" he grumbles. </p><p>Woohyun chuckles, and turns to go. \"Don\u2019t miss me too much,\" he says. </p><p>He knows Sungyeol\u2019s gotten up behind him, and for a moment, he thinks about turning, about grabbing Sungyeol by the wrist, about holding him against the wall and kissing him until neither of them can breath. He thinks about sucking bright red marks into his skin, even though Sungyeol is usually the possessive one, and Woohyun\u2019s always been glad for the power of BB cream. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>He grabs his bag, his coat\u2014the scarf, a dark blue\u2014from the floor, and bends down to tie his shoes, Sungyeol trailing behind him like an overgrown dog. </p><p>He should\u2019ve gone before Sungyeol had awoken. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, when Woohyun straightens. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. He reaches for the door handle, slowly, unsure if this was really okay, unsure if maybe they should talk about it\u2014he hopes they don\u2019t, he hopes they won\u2019t\u2014or if they\u2019re really going to pretend nothing\u2019s happened. </p><p>(He hopes they won\u2019t do that, either.) </p><p>He opens the door. </p><p>Sungyeol reaches past him, and closes it. </p><p>\"What\u2014\" but Woohyun doesn\u2019t get to finish that, not when Sungyeol\u2019s grabbed his shirt. Woohyun\u2019s things fall to the floor. </p><p>Sungyeol is suddenly so close, and last night still lingers on his skin, and then Sungyeol\u2019s lips are against his and Woohyun\u2019s thoughts disappear into the rush of blood. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s tongue slips between Woohyun\u2019s parted lips, his hand cupped behind Woohyun\u2019s neck. He\u2019s hot against him, and Woohyun slides his hands around Sungyeol\u2019s back, his pants suddenly too tight. Sungyeol moans into his mouth and Woohyun worries briefly about the neighbours, but that thought too is soon lost in the heat of Sungyeol sucking at his lip. </p><p>His head is dizzy with need\u2014Woohyun pulls back, pushes Sungyeol away, and this time, he pushes Sungyeol against the door, and this time, he kisses Sungyeol hungrily. Sungyeol whines, grinding against him, his need fueling Woohyun\u2019s own. He pushes his tongue past Sungyeol\u2019s lips, Sungyeol briefly pressing them shut before he lets him in. He holds Sungyeol down, presses a hand against his bare chest, even when Sungyeol tries to pull away\u2014he feels his mind\u2019s eye slowly going black with a need for air, and he knows Sungyeol, less prepared, is too. </p><p>He kisses him, again, until Sungyeol finally pushes him away, the both of them breaths ragged. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s lips are wet and swollen, his cheeks flushed, his eyes wide, his mouth open. </p><p>Sungyeol can be possessive, but right now, Woohyun wants Sungyeol, wants him in every way. Sungyeol\u2019s height works, here, as Woohyun holds him against the door, sucking at the side of Sungyeol\u2019s neck, until Sungyeol\u2019s an incoherent mess clutching at Woohyun\u2019s shirt. Woohyun pulls away, presses a soft kiss against the side of his jaw, and another, and another, each one following the next. Heat pools in his body, in the base of his stomach, with every small noise Sungyeol makes, with every small shift of Sungyeol against him, and Woohyun kisses him again and again, and then, in a fit of insanity, slips his hand underneath the elastic of Sungyeol\u2019s waistband, his hand pressing against Sungyeol\u2019s cock, through his underwear still sticky from last night\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s face is buried in his shoulder, and Woohyun presses his head against the cool door, grounding and cold against him. Sungyeol\u2019s sounds, muffled, slide through his shirt and deep into his skin, and Woohyun rubs his fingers against Sungyeol, drags out those sounds until Sungyeol falls limp against him, his arms wrapping around Woohyun\u2019s chest. </p><p>He\u2019s warm. Too warm. </p><p>Woohyun steps away, and he sees Sungyeol stumble. </p><p>\"Have a good day,\" Woohyun says. His voice is less steady than he would\u2019ve liked it to be, and his mind is a mess of unsurety. </p><p>He looks a mess, he knows it. Sungyeol looks a mess, red marks scattered across his skin, and Woohyun doubts he looks much better. Somehow, that matters less than the bewildered look in Sungyeol\u2019s eyes (what do you <i>want</i>), the unsaid words he can nearly see. </p><p>But he can\u2019t stay, and he runs a hand through his hair, and he pushes past Sungyeol and into the empty hallway.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"You want to talk about it?\" </p><p>Woohyun looks up to Kibum perching himself at the edge of his desk. His friend\u2019s hair is blond again, and Woohyun rakes a hand through his own recently dyed hair. </p><p>\"About what?\" he asks. </p><p>\"You didn\u2019t flirt with the waitresses today,\" Kibum laughs, but his eyes are serious. \"No, but really, you doing okay? Did the interview\u2026\" </p><p>Woohyun shakes his head and leans back in his chair. \"It went fine,\" he says. \"I\u2019ve just had a lot on my plate lately.\" </p><p>Kibum pulls a face in sympathy. Woohyun\u2019s told him bits and pieces, more than he\u2019s told anyone else, at least. But not Sungyeol. Never Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I called my mom last night,\" he says. Woohyun\u2019s slipped into Korean, even though the office is mostly empty. </p><p>\"And?\" </p><p>It\u2019s a bad habit, and he shakes his head. </p><p>\"I need some coffee. Come with?\" This time, in English. </p><p>\"Do I need my coat?\" Kibum asks. </p><p>Woohyun hesitates for a moment, then gestures upwards. \"Let\u2019s stay inside.\" </p><p>\"Just the usual,\" Woohyun says, once they get out the door. \"I guess she\u2019s just worried.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s what moms are for,\" Kibum says. </p><p>\"And\u2026\" Woohyun hesitates. He hasn\u2019t thought this through entirely himself\u2014he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s too soon to talk about it, if he shouldn\u2019t mull over it more. But it\u2019s Kibum, and he\u2019s always been close with Kibum. If Woohyun believed in other halves, that\u2019d be it. </p><p>Kibum waits, and Woohyun waits until they\u2019re out of the elevator, because there\u2019s a pair of women making small talk who get off on the same floor. He steps to the side, away from the coffee shop, out of the way. </p><p>His heart is loud. </p><p>\"I\u2019m thinking about moving to Korea.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re <i>what?</i>?\" </p><p>Woohyun grimaces, shaking his head for Kibum to keep his voice down. \"I don\u2019t even know if 'thinking' is the right word for it,\" he says. \"Considering?\" </p><p>\"That means it\u2019s a real possibility.\" Kibum shakes his head. \"You\u2019ll need more than a coffee break to tell me about this.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun laughs dryly. \"Like I said, a lot on my plate.\" </p><p>\"Your mom?\" Kibum asks. He nods towards the coffee shop. Woohyun agrees, and turns down the hall. They should at least return with coffee. </p><p>\"Kind of. They\u2019re planning on moving back, when dad\u2019s finished this project. And you know that my big brother moved back to live with our grandparents in high school, right? So\u2026\" </p><p>\"So it\u2019d be just you here,\" Kibum says. </p><p>Woohyun nods. It wouldn\u2019t make any real difference, not for him. He hasn\u2019t lived <i>with</i> his parents for\u2026how ever many years ago second year of university was, and that\u2019d only been a summer. Really, not since they\u2019d moved to the west coast and to another country and he\u2019d stayed here. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know what to do,\" Woohyun says. \"Even my dad thinks it\u2019s a bad idea, but if everyone\u2019s there, and\u2026\" he trails off, pressing his mouth into a thin line. </p><p>\"Your grandparents?\" </p><p>Woohyun nods. It\u2019s hard to forget how old they\u2019ve become, just as hard it is to remember how old they\u2019ve become. Hard to forget how thin his grandmother\u2019s hand had been in his, how fragile her skin had seemed, and at the same time, hard to remember when it\u2019d happened, or maybe, hard to remember when he\u2019d realised. This, he had mentioned to Kibum. When his father\u2019s father had passed away five years ago, it was the first time someone he\u2019d known had. They hadn\u2019t been that close\u2014they couldn\u2019t have been, not when they\u2019d moved across an ocean when Woohyun had been seven and it was with his mother\u2019s parents he\u2019d stayed with over the summers. But the news had hit him harder than he\u2019d thought it could\u2019ve, like a great, taloned claw had wrapped around his heart and couldn't let go until it\u2019d been torn from every vein and artery in his chest. </p><p><i>You could come with us</i>, his mother had said, and the idea had hit him as hard as the news had. </p><p> \"I know, I know, I\u2019d be throwing away my entire life, my job, my career, my friends, and then there\u2019s the military, I <i>know</i>.\" </p><p>Kibum places a comforting hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, at least you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that job interview,\" he jokes. </p><p>\"Thanks,\" Woohyun says glumly. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s talk about this later?\" Kibum says, and they\u2019re at the counter, and Woohyun nods, and goes to order his medium coffee two milk two sugar, because this isn\u2019t even half of it. </p><p>When it rains, it pours, he\u2019d told Sungyeol. </p><p>It\u2019s raining now. </p><p>Kibum had left to finish up some work he had to do, and Woohyun had lingered in the bar, and he regrets it now that the light drizzle he was sure would clear has turned into a steady rain, defying the weather report\u2019s ten percent chance of precipitation. Ten percent wasn\u2019t zero, and even a zero percent prediction didn\u2019t mean a zero percent chance in reality. It still has a chance to clear, though, and it\u2019s still early, not even eight, so Woohyun gets another beer and sits at the table near the window. </p><p>There\u2019s the job, there\u2019s Korea, and then there\u2019s Sungyeol. </p><p>Sungyeol, who should be the least important of the three. Sungyeol, who Woohyun had firmly placed back into the category of 'friend'. Sungyeol, who Woohyun had been terrible at keeping in that category of 'friend'. </p><p>It was difficult to build a dam, easier to keep it closed, and easiest to break it open. </p><p>But rebuilding it was an entirely different story. </p><p>There\u2019d always be cracks, weakness, small leaks that were forever being patched up, and always the fear that it could come crashing down again.  </p><p>And then there\u2019s Sungyeol, tapping at the window, and what the hell? Think of the devil and the devil will come. </p><p>\"Look at this loser drinking alone.\" Sungyeol shakes off the umbrella and drops into the seat across from Woohyun. </p><p>\"Well now there\u2019s two of us,\" Woohyun replies. </p><p>Sungyeol snorts, flagging over a server and asking for whatever Woohyun\u2019s having.  </p><p>\"You don\u2019t like IPAs,\" Woohyun points out. </p><p>\"Yeah, well I don\u2019t like you,\" Sungyeol shoots back. Woohyun can\u2019t help but laugh at the elementary playground response, and even Sungyeol looks suitably disgusted with his comeback.  </p><p>\"Another late night?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Last one,\" Sungyeol says. He cracks his neck and leans back in the chair and honestly, he does look more relaxed than he\u2019s looked in weeks. </p><p>\"Not out celebrating with the crew?\" </p><p>The corners of Sungyeol\u2019s mouth draw down in reply to that. \"After spending twelve hours a day with them for the past week? No thanks.\" He pauses, and whatever he\u2019s about to say next clearly pains him, from the scowl on his face. \"The break was good.\" </p><p>Woohyun lets out a puff of self-satisfied laughter. \"I\u2019m always right,\" he says smugly.  </p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, whatever\u2014thank you,\" Sungyeol says, as his beer arrives. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re celebrating with me instead?\" </p><p>\"Don\u2019t flatter yourself,\" Sungyeol says. \"I\u2019ll be celebrating alone with a good night\u2019s sleep.\" </p><p>\"There are so many things I could say to that but I won\u2019t, because I\u2019m nice,\" Woohyun says, chuckling. Sungyeol glares at him, sipping at his beer. His nose instantly wrinkles in distaste, and Woohyun bursts out laughing. </p><p>\"Gimme that,\" he says, reaching for Sungyeol\u2019s beer, still held midair.  </p><p>\"Hey, I\u2019m drinking this!\" </p><p>\"No you\u2019re not, I am,\" Woohyun says to Sungyeol, and then to the passing server: \"an amber ale, please.\" </p><p>Sungyeol grudgingly relinquishes his hold, and Woohyun drains his glass and pulls Sungyeol\u2019s in front of him. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not carrying you home if you drink too much,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not you,\" Woohyun says sweetly. He pulls his legs out of the way before Sungyeol has a chance to kick them\u2014he ends up kicking the chair instead, and just desserts and all that. </p><p>\"You want to order food?\" Woohyun asks, after Sungyeol\u2019s settled down and stopped sulking. \"Have you eaten?\" </p><p>\"Sushi again, worked late,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs. \"Only good thing about end of quarters.\" </p><p>\"The overtime pay can\u2019t hurt,\" Woohyun says. The server returns, and Woohyun gestures towards Sungyeol. Woohyun\u2019s never tried this one before, but whatever it is, Sungyeol prefers it to 'whatever he was having' because he lets out a content sigh as he puts down his glass. </p><p>\"Could be worse,\" Sungyeol agrees.  </p><p>\"So where were you going?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Huh?\" </p><p>Woohyun nods towards the darkened streets. \"You missed the subway by a good block,\" he says. </p><p>\"Oh. That.\" Sungyeol\u2019s face darkens\u2014except that\u2019s not it, really. One corner of his mouth pulls outwards a little, his eyes take on a nearly sullen look, his shoulders tense, and Woohyun knows that this isn\u2019t something Sungyeol wants to talk about, and that it isn\u2019t his place to pry. </p><p>\"But good thing you missed the subway because now you don\u2019t have to miss me,\" Woohyun sing-songs. He probably definitely deserves the sharp kick to the shins he receives, even if it does hurt like a bitch. </p><p>\"God, will you ever be less annoying?\" </p><p>\"You love it,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>Sungyeol snorts in disbelief, taking a long pull from his beer. </p><p>\"Did you get dumped?\" he asks, after. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart jumps, as he processes Sungyeol\u2019s words. No, yes, I. He blinks. Because he\u2019s sitting alone. \"Of course not, who\u2019d dump me?\" he says. </p><p>\"Everyone,\" Sungyeol says bluntly. Woohyun winces. Too close to home. He\u2019d certainly never been the one doing the dumping. </p><p>\"If you mean Kibum, he left to finish work,\" Woohyun says, keeping his voice light. \"Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not breaking up any time soon.\" </p><p>Something flashes over Sungyeol\u2019s face and disappears just as quickly, as his brows shoot up in disbelief. \"Is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\" he says. </p><p>\"Because I tell you everything, right?\" and it\u2019s a little too sharp but either Sungyeol doesn\u2019t notice or Sungyeol doesn\u2019t care, and whichever it is, Woohyun\u2019ll take it. </p><p>\"That would imply we were friends,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun\u2019s stomach twists itself into knots that has nothing to do with the beer. </p><p>\"Or that you were my diary\u2014which I think I might prefer,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>Sungyeol gags. \"Ugh, I don\u2019t want to know all your dirty thoughts.\" </p><p>\"Good thing I don\u2019t keep a diary,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d prefer that I didn\u2019t exist?\" </p><p>\"No! No, what?\" Woohyun answers too quickly, and then back pedals because Sungyeol\u2019s laughing, and then wishes he hadn\u2019t done that either, because the look Sungyeol\u2019s giving him is far too piercing for his liking, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t have a fast response, and maybe it\u2019s because three beers do tend to slow down thought processes. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s grateful for the silence that takes over instead, and they\u2019re just two men in their twenties at a table near the window, each nursing their own beer. The rain hasn\u2019t quite let up, and Sungyeol was right about one thing\u2014that they were friends. </p><p>Friends who end up slipping into Woohyun\u2019s apartment, the lights already off, and Sungyeol\u2019s hand brushes too accidentally against Woohyun\u2019s thigh. </p><p>\"Sunggyu\u2019s sleeping,\" Woohyun murmurs. The apartment is dark, but they both know their way around, when it\u2019s dark, because none of this is new. So Sungyeol drags Woohyun to the bathroom, where the door is the thickest and the running water of the shower masks the sounds Sungyeol makes, when Woohyun\u2019s fingers trace dangerously close against the inside of Sungyeol\u2019s thigh. But Woohyun can\u2019t shower forever, and Sungyeol <i>can</i> be quiet, if he tries, but Woohyun presses a hand over his mouth anyway as his fingers circle Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and Sungyeol\u2019s tongue is hot against his palm. Woohyun wipes his hand against Sungyeol\u2019s arm, shooting him a look of disgust\u2014Sungyeol grabs Woohyun\u2019s shoulder and pulls him close, his mouth hot as they kiss, and fuck, fuck fuck <i>fuck</i> Woohyun feels like he could come from just this, from just the way Sungyeol uses his mouth, how he\u2019s learned to use his mouth, and he doesn\u2019t know how he keeps it together, how he keeps himself tangled up and cohesive and just conscious enough to know how to touch Sungyeol so he\u2019s whining into him and on the edge and so he feels <i>good</i> but maybe that\u2019s just something he\u2019s learned and can never forget. He\u2019s barely taken Sungyeol into his mouth when there\u2019s fingers pulling at his hair and when Woohyun glances up, still sucking Sungyeol through his orgasm, Sungyeol\u2019s biting his fist to keep from crying out and <i>fuck</i> Woohyun already knows that\u2019s what he\u2019ll be remembering when he touches himself for the next week, at least. But Sungyeol jerks him off rough and fast and Woohyun doesn\u2019t have time to think, doesn\u2019t have time to look before his come spills over both their stomachs, and Woohyun knows he\u2019ll be showering in the morning again, for sure. </p><p>He does, in the morning\u2014this time, alone.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sunlight floods through the window, because Woohyun forgot to close the blinds, again. It wakes him, the unfamiliar warmth of someone next to him bringing him the rest of the way. The covers are kicked halfway off, because they\u2019re a little too heavy for this kind of late spring, and because Sungyeol might as well be a furnace. His finger brushes against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, not quite sure if he\u2019s real. </p><p>Thin fingers wrap around his wrist, and Woohyun turns his head to see Sungyeol, eyes open, an uncharacteristically soft smile on his face.  </p><p>\"Awake?\" Sungyeol says. His voice is still a little rough, and Woohyun reaches up to brush his hand against Sungyeol\u2019s face, but stops, hand falling against Sungyeol\u2019s arm instead. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. \"Yeah, I am.\" </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hair is mussed, and there\u2019s a faint mark in stark contrast against his pale skin, nestled in the crook of his shoulder. His hair falls messy over his eyes, but it\u2019s Sungyeol who brushes Woohyun\u2019s hair from his face. It\u2019s Sungyeol who rolls over, catching Woohyun\u2019s lips in a slow kiss. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart pounds in his chest. </p><p>Sungyeol kisses him, slow and patient, and Woohyun\u2019s eyes are half open, and Sungyeol\u2019s are closed, and one of his hands is still on his wrist and the other rests against the side of his jaw. He\u2019s so <i>close</i> and Woohyun feels like he can\u2019t breathe, like if he breathes Sungyeol will disappear, Sungyeol will pull away, face twisted in disgust, because Sungyeol has never liked being touched\u2014but Sungyeol is patient (he\u2019s never patient) and Woohyun\u2019s world narrows to the incessant pressure (pleasure) of Sungyeol\u2019s mouth against his. </p><p>It\u2019s like the first time, and it\u2019s nothing like the first time, because the first time had been rough and messy and Woohyun\u2019s hand sliding down Sungyeol\u2019s leg and Sungyeol with his back to the room and everyone sleeping in it and Sungyeol had kissed him desperately, like it was something wrong, like it was a crime to be hidden from the world and it was, it had been, and when Sungyeol had come, Woohyun had pressed his hand over his mouth because Myungsoo\u2014<i>Myungsoo</i>\u2014had stirred and rolled over and Sungyeol couldn\u2019t\u2014<i>couldn\u2019t</i>\u2014wake them.  </p><p>But this is the morning sun pouring in through the windows, and Woohyun\u2019s hand rests against the small of Sungyeol\u2019s back, and he catches Sungyeol\u2019s lips between his, and he\u2019s too solid, too warm, too close to not be real.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Should\u2019ve brought an umbrella,\" Howon comments. Woohyun shivers lightly as he glances up at the clouds in the dark sky. It\u2019s barely raining, more of a drizzle really. </p><p>\"It said nothing about rain,\" Sungyeol says sullenly. His face is half buried in his scarf, and his hands are deep in his pockets. He needs a haircut, and his ears are pink. </p><p>\"Pretty sure it mentioned some precipitation,\" Woohyun comments mildly. </p><p>\"Yeah, <i>snow</i>,\" Sungyeol says. \"White, fluffy, not wet?\" </p><p>\"I know what snow is,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>They\u2019re heading down to the mall to see the new action comedy movie, and Woohyun wishes he\u2019d suggested the subway, because Sungyeol is cranky when he\u2019s wet. Kibum\u2019s checking times on his phone, and to be honest, Woohyun\u2019s a little too cold to deal with Sungyeol right now. He should\u2019ve brought a heavier coat, is what he should\u2019ve brought, never mind the umbrella. </p><p>\"You want 3D?\" Kibum asks. \"Should we grab dinner before or after?\" </p><p>\"When\u2019s the next showing?\" Woohyun asks. He hangs back a few steps and Kibum hands him his phone.  </p><p>\"Six forty five, seven thirty, take your pick,\" Kibum says. </p><p>\"Six forty five and dinner after,\" Howon says, then laughs. \"If Myungsoo had made it he\u2019d probably want dinner twice.\" </p><p>\"Is that 3D?\" Sungyeol asks. He tugs the phone from Woohyun\u2019s hand, scrolling down the screen, all of them huddled around it, as they walk. \"Oh, that animal movie\u2019s out too.\" </p><p>\"We could see that next week,\" Howon suggests. A notification pops up and Kibum takes his phone back from Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Hang on, I need to take this,\" Kibum says\u2014work call, he means. He nods at Howon and Sungyeol. \"Get the tickets, we\u2019ll catch up.\" </p><p>Woohyun glances at the time on his own phone\u2014they were cutting it close, if they wanted to make the six forty five.  </p><p>\"Sure,\" Howon says. </p><p>\"You can pay for mine,\" Woohyun tells Sungyeol sweetly. </p><p>\"Something you\u2019re not telling us?\" Howon wolf whistles, and Sungyeol looks ready to kill Woohyun. </p><p>\"Get your own ticket,\" Sungyeol says. \"We\u2019re only getting one extra.\" </p><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll cover,\" Howon calls out, as he drags Sungyeol away. </p><p>Woohyun tucks his hands in his pockets as he waits for Kibum to finish up his call. </p><p>\"Everything fine?\" he asks. </p><p>\"Yeah, Amber said she\u2019ll take care of it,\" he says, putting away his phone. He gives Woohyun a sharp sideways glance\u2014Woohyun\u2019s eyebrows shoot up as he looks at him quizzically. </p><p>\"Something on my face?\" he asks. </p><p>\"It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\" </p><p>Woohyun feels his heart drop out of his chest. </p><p>\"It\u2019s who?\" he says. He begins to walk away, but Kibum grabs his arm, forcing him to slow down, and Woohyun knows he\u2019s not getting out of this one. </p><p>\"<i>It\u2019s who?</i>\" Kibum echoes in disbelief. He nods down the sidewalk, where Sungyeol and Howon have already disappeared behind the crowds. \"You know who!\" </p><p>\"Can\u2019t say I know Voldemort,\" Woohyun says lightly. </p><p>\"Woohyun, I swear\u2014\" </p><p>\"Look, we\u2019re just friends, okay?\" Woohyun snaps. He pulls away from Kibum and walks faster, but Kibum catches up in a few steps and matches his pace. Not now, not now, not now, he thinks. Small drops of rain hit his skin, linger in his hair. </p><p>\"Damn, you weren\u2019t kidding about a lot on your plate,\" Kibum says quietly. </p><p>\"We\u2019re not talking about this,\" Woohyun says. \"Please. Sungyeol\u2019s a friend, that\u2019s it.\" </p><p>Kibum laughs softly. \"Your love sick puppy dog face says something different.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019d rather think of it as a lovable puppy\u2014\" </p><p>\"Woohyun.\" </p><p>\"Kibum,\" Woohyun says, matching Kibum\u2019s tone with a mock serious one.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m serious,\" Kibum says, and Woohyun\u2019s not getting out of this one. \"And why didn\u2019t you tell me? Out of all people\u2026\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no good way to say 'hey by the way Sungyeol and I are banging'?\" Woohyun\u2019s voice drops into a low hiss. </p><p>\"Wait you\u2019re\u2014\" From the look on Kibum\u2019s face and his aborted question, he hadn\u2019t even entertained the idea it\u2019d gone that far, that he\u2019d probably thought Woohyun was caught up in some hopeless, empty crush. </p><p>Woohyun wants to laugh, but it gets stuck somewhere between horror and regret. It\u2019d <i>started</i> from that far, and they\u2019d gotten here instead.  </p><p>\"But you\u2019re just friends,\" Kibum says flatly. </p><p>\"That\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\" The cat's out of the bag, might as well give up the ghost, but Woohyun clings desperately to the last remnants at the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box. Kibum\u2019d caught him off guard, and Woohyun\u2019s always been good on his feet, but he\u2019s not sure anyone\u2019s ready for their best friend to spring their deepest secrets on them. \"We\u2019re friends.\" </p><p>\"With benefits?\" Kibum asks, and yeah, yes, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it is, and Woohyun nods, not trusting himself to speak. After all, they sure as hell weren\u2019t boyfriends, and if not that, then what were they?  </p><p>Kibum blows out a long disbelieving breath. \"Either you\u2019re lying to yourself or you\u2019re really that stupid, and Nam Woohyun you are the furthest thing from stupid.\" </p><p>Their conversation has carried them through the crowds and to the entrance of the theater, Woohyun\u2019s pace cutting down the time to nearly half their usual leisurely pace. </p><p>\"What do you want me to say?\" Woohyun says, voice low as Kibum pushes in close after him through the doors. \"Yes, I\u2019m lying to myself, yes, I probably have some disgusting love sick puppy dog face going on, and <i>yes</i> I still have far more feelings than I should?\" and this is too much, too many things Kibum didn\u2019t need to know. </p><p>\"Hey, what\u2019re you two lovebirds talking about?\" Howon yells, and Woohyun blows a kiss at Kibum, and definitely doesn\u2019t look at Sungyeol as he jogs to join their friends. </p><p>Kibum shoots him sharp looks the entire night, as Woohyun drapes an arm around Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders, as Woohyun laughs at Sungyeol\u2019s terrible joke, as Woohyun teases Sungyeol until Sungyeol shoves a handful of popcorn down Woohyun\u2019s shirt. But even Kibum isn\u2019t going to put a damper on the good mood, and no one disagrees when Woohyun invites themselves over to Sungyeol\u2019s place afterwards, because Sungyeol has a PS4 and lives alone. Besides, Woohyun says, he\u2019s pretty sure Sunggyu\u2019d said he had 'someone over' and Woohyun\u2019s fine with giving that 'someone' some space. Howon says next time, but Kibum agrees a little too readily.  </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hand lingers a little too long on his leg as they ride the subway up, and Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches. The ground is soaked and the air is wet with a long gone storm, and all that\u2019s left is the night chill of an autumn that\u2019s nearly spilled into winter. Drinking games aren\u2019t quite as fun with three people, but they manage, and maybe Woohyun is a little drunker than he really is and even Kibum has to go home, eventually\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hand is on Woohyun\u2019s thigh and Woohyun tangles his fingers in Sungyeol\u2019s hair, and kisses him without warning, but Sungyeol doesn\u2019t need it, not when this is the only thing they\u2019ve been waiting for all night, all evening, all\u2014 </p><p>They\u2019re both breathing hard when they pull away, and Sungyeol\u2019s cheeks are flushed from a little more than just the past few minutes. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s get you to bed,\" Woohyun says, because Woohyun might not have been as drunk as he\u2019d seemed, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been a bit of a lightweight.  </p><p>\"Come here,\" Sungyeol says, and he tugs Woohyun back down, catches him in another long kiss, and god Woohyun needs him but he pulls Sungyeol to his feet. </p><p>\"Bed,\" Woohyun says firmly. Sungyeol whines, but Sungyeol is also a stick, and it\u2019s too easy to haul him to his room, push him into his bed. He <i>is</i> drunk, because he rolls over onto his side and seems half asleep already, and an ache grows in Woohyun\u2019s chest, but no, not like this, never like this. Not when Sungyeol has room to regret it in the morning. The faint aura of disappointment settles about him, but Sungyeol\u2019s couch isn\u2019t uncomfortable, and he\u2019s slept there before, but as he\u2019s pulling the covers over Sungyeol, Sungyeol grabs his arm, and it catches him by surprise. </p><p>\"Where are you going?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Nowhere,\" Woohyun says. \"You\u2019re going to sleep.\" </p><p>He shakes Sungyeol off, but Sungyeol just wraps an arm about Woohyun\u2019s waist, and Sungyeol is a stick but Sungyeol\u2019s been working out without him, and it\u2019s enough to pull Woohyun onto the bed, tumbling on top of Sungyeol. Sungyeol\u2019s elbow jabs into Woohyun\u2019s stomach, until Sungyeol pulls that arm out and throws that arm around Woohyun too. </p><p>\"Sleep with me,\" Sungyeol says, and he nuzzles into Woohyun\u2019s neck. </p><p>And. Fine. Fine\u2014 \"Just sleep,\" Woohyun says, and he means it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up, half of him cold, the other half blanketed under Sungyeol. It\u2019s still night, not a hint of sun outside the window, and he glances at Sungyeol still asleep. He remembers waking up to an empty bed, but he also remembers waking up to Sungyeol. He slides a little closer to Sungyeol, pulls the covers back over them both, and Sungyeol is warm. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up to Sungyeol staring at him, hair messy, eyes still bleary from sleep. </p><p>\"Awake?\" Sungyeol says, and his voice is rough and hoarse. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says, and clears his throat. \"Sort of.\" </p><p>This close, Woohyun can see the faint lines of exhaustion about Sungyeol\u2019s eyes, the shadows underneath. He\u2019s lost weight, and Woohyun remembers Sungyeol from university with soft cheeks and a soft stomach but now he\u2019s all sharp angles and he needs more sleep. Sungyeol is closer, and closer, and when Woohyun doesn\u2019t move, Sungyeol\u2019s hand is on his shoulder and he\u2019s kissing Woohyun, wet and sloppy. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s awake, but only sort of, but he\u2019s okay with this, okay with Sungyeol taking the lead as he slides his hand up Sungyeol\u2019s back, under his shirt. He kisses back lazily, until he\u2019s teasing, and he smiles a smile no one can see when Sungyeol whines, kissing him harder and more desperate. He keeps it slow, his hand creeping up to Sungyeol\u2019s neck, and he runs his fingers through Sungyeol\u2019s hair. Sungyeol\u2019s fingers are bruising against his skin, and he bites down against Woohyun\u2019s lip. Woohyun jerks away, and Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is curled in a self satisfied smirk.  </p><p>\"You fucker,\" Woohyun breathes\u2014then crushes Sungyeol to him, and there\u2019s still the faint smell of alcohol, but this close it doesn\u2019t matter, not with Sungyeol\u2019s mouth so hot against his. Sungyeol pulls at his hair, and Woohyun digs his fingers into Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder as he kisses Sungyeol. </p><p>And it feels so <i>good</i>, every bit of it, every bit of him, and from the way Sungyeol rubs against him, he knows it\u2019s good for Sungyeol too. His body is hot, and the blankets tangle between their legs when Woohyun pulls Sungyeol over until they\u2019re both on their sides. </p><p>It seems an eternity when they pull away, Woohyun\u2019s hand lingering fond against Sungyeol\u2019s face, and the slight curl of a smile rests on the corner of Sungyeol\u2019s lips. The world is still gray behind the blinds, but it\u2019s almost winter and the sun rises ever later. </p><p>\"Good morning,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol laughs. </p><p>\"God, I need coffee,\" Sungyeol groans as he sits up. </p><p>\"Should\u2019ve had more water,\" Woohyun says. He lies there for a moment more, watches Sungyeol shuffle his way to the edge of the bed. He shucks off his clothes from last night, and Woohyun tears his eyes away from that back, and the already purpling mark he\u2019d left on Sungyeol\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"Too late for that,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun gets up too. </p><p>He\u2019s still wearing last night\u2019s clothes, and he yawns as he smoothes down his hair. </p><p>\"Do you want a change?\" Sungyeol asks him. He\u2019s dressed in a loose tee and pair of shorts, and he nods at Woohyun\u2019s rumpled clothes. </p><p>\"It\u2019s alright,\" Woohyun says, but Sungyeol\u2019s already tossing him a clean shirt and jeans, the ones that actually fit him.  </p><p>\"You better wash them before you give them back,\" Sungyeol says, and then he\u2019s disappeared into the bathroom. </p><p>Woohyun changes, because there\u2019s no point not to, and he folds his own clothes and stuffs it in his bag, still tossed onto the floor next to Sungyeol\u2019s couch. His phone is there too, and it\u2019s down to 10% battery, but it\u2019s enough to know it\u2019s not even nine. He wanders into Sungyeol\u2019s kitchen, and fills the kettle. It takes him a few minutes to find the coffee, and by that time, Sungyeol\u2019s out of the bathroom and he grabs the grinder from the counter. </p><p>\"What do you want for breakfast?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Just coffee,\" Woohyun says. \"I told Sunggyu I\u2019d do the groceries this week.\" </p><p>\"This early?\" Sungyeol asks, surprised. </p><p>\"Better early than late,\" Woohyun says. He leans against the counter as Sungyeol makes a pour over, pushing over Woohyun\u2019s mug before making himself one. Woohyun sips at his coffee, hot, watching the lines of Sungyeol\u2019s arms as he directs the water in a steady stream. The kitchen smells like coffee, and by the time Woohyun leaves, he too smells like coffee.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol is sharp elbows and angry glances this morning, and Woohyun remembers this from university, hair stuck up on the wrong side and shirt a little too rumpled from having spent the night under a pile of textbooks. There\u2019s bags under his eyes and the whites of them are more red than anything else, and Woohyun knows that sooner or later he\u2019s going to snap. </p><p>\"Eat,\" Woohyun tells him, shoving the fresh bagels he\u2019d picked up on the way here into Sungyeol\u2019s arms. </p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" </p><p>\"You look like shit,\" Woohyun says, and it\u2019s probably the wrong thing to say. He sighs, pushes his hair back, shakes his head. \"Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re not wrong,\" Sungyeol says sharply. \"You didn\u2019t answer my question.\" </p><p>\"You didn\u2019t reply to my texts,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Since when did you care?\" </p><p>\"Since when did I\u2014look, just eat, alright?\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s seen this enough to know he hasn\u2019t slept, he hasn\u2019t eaten, at least not properly or regularly, and he\u2019s still in the doorway, Sungyeol\u2019s eyes as sharp as daggers. </p><p>\"Call if you need anything,\" Woohyun says. He leaves before Sungyeol can kick him out. </p><p>\"Hm? No, nothing's wrong?\" Myungsoo'd said when he'd called, three days after the last time he'd gotten hold of Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Never mind,\" Woohyun had quickly said. \"He's probably just busy.\" </p><p>(He's probably just ignoring me.) </p><p>But Sungyeol shows up at his apartment two days later and he's brought take-out. He doesn't look much better, but Woohyun's learned not to press, because press too hard on anything and it'll inevitably shatter. He hovers on the edge of staying and leaving, but Woohyun's missed him and he sits a little closer to him than he needs to, and rests his hand on his shoulder, on his leg, on his arm until Sungyeol's shrugging him off every few seconds. But Sungyeol does stay, and he does climb into bed with Woohyun. </p><p>He's warm against Woohyun's chest, and in the darkness of Woohyun's room, he doesn't push him away, but nor does he pull him closer. Woohyun fumbles under the covers, blind, for Sungyeol's fingers, clutches both their hands to Sungyeol's chest. Sungyeol's awake, he can tell from his staggered breaths, from the stiffness in his shoulders. </p><p>In the end, Woohyun draws away, and sleeps facing Sungyeol's back. </p><p>There's an unnerving familiarity here, only this time, there's so much more to lose. </p><p>And Sungyeol does call, and 'come over', he says, and that's all the prompting Woohyun needs to grab his coat and his keys and the subway ride over seems longer than usual. Did you need anything, Woohyun had asked, but Sungyeol had said no, just come over, and here he was, Sungyeol kissing him before the door's even closed. </p><p>He's lost weight, not that he ever has much weight to lose, and his bones seem sharper than usual. Woohyun needs to drag him to the gym again, but Sungyeol\u2019s been busy, lately. He leans into Woohyun's touch, but there's a touch of hesitation, a touch of exhaustion, and when Woohyun pulls away, Sungyeol doesn't stop him. </p><p>The light's off, but when Woohyun reaches for the switch, Sungyeol stops him, hand on his. </p><p>\"Talk to me,\" Woohyun says, and it's quiet, because the room is quiet, and the darkness swallows all. </p><p>\"It's nothing,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun wants to scream that no, it's not nothing, but that's not Woohyun, and he doesn't. </p><p>\"Is it me?\" Woohyun asks, and Sungyeol snorts, then stands. </p><p>\"Don't flatter yourself,\" he says.  </p><p>\"Can I\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, you can't,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun wonders if Sungyeol means 'no, you can't help,' or 'no, you can't do anything,' or just 'no, you can't', something so broad and overreaching that Woohyun can only sit on the edge of the couch while Sungyeol stands in the middle of the room, a shadow shrouded in shadows. </p><p>\"Alright,\" Woohyun says. The crouch creaks as he comes to stand behind Sungyeol. He hovers, unsure if it's a 'no, you can't touch me,' or 'no, you can't come closer,' but Sungyeol doesn't pull away when Woohyun gathers him to his chest. \"Alright, but I'll be here,\" he says, and suddenly, he wonders if what Sungyeol had meant was 'no, you can't make me feel better, because it <i>is</i> you', and the room's too dark for Woohyun to know which one is the lie.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Winter bowls in without warning, and the city is buried in snow the first week of December. </p><p>It\u2019s cold enough that the snow\u2019s not going anywhere any time soon, but not cold enough that the mid-day sun won\u2019t melt it mid-day, only for it to freeze over during the night. The sidewalks are salted liberally, but by the time evening rolls around, a patch of black ice still pulls Sungyeol\u2019s feet from under him, and he\u2019s lucky he hits the ground back first, not head first, his bag taking the brunt of the fall. </p><p>\"<i>Ice</i>?\" Woohyun laughs, when he shows up some fifteen minutes later, after he calls Woohyun to fend off concerned onlookers. \"Really?\" </p><p>Sungyeol is sitting on the steps outside the shopping center, and Woohyun reassures the two young women hovering near him that he\u2019ll take Sungyeol to a doctor or the hospital, because it looked like he\u2019d hit his head pretty hard. He\u2019d definitely blacked out for a few moments, they told him in hushed voices. </p><p>\"Shut up,\" Sungyeol grumbles. \"It\u2019s not like I could see it.\" </p><p>\"Can you stand?\" Woohyun asks. He holds a hand out, and he\u2019s not sure if Sungyeol will take it, but he does. He sways a little unsteadily, but stays on his feet. Sungyeol gingerly brushes the back of his head, his face contorting into pain when he does. Woohyun\u2019s chest constricts, and he grips Sungyeol\u2019s hand tighter.  </p><p>\"Good thing you can\u2019t get any dumber,\" Woohyun jokes\u2014but when Sungyeol pulls away to retort, he nearly falls before Woohyun grabs him about the waist. \"Okay, we\u2019re going to the doctor.\" </p><p>\"I just hit my head,\" Sungyeol says, but he doesn\u2019t stop Woohyun from calling a cab. </p><p>There\u2019s not much to do but rest, and like hell he\u2019s letting Sungyeol go home to an empty apartment. He calls Myungsoo, because Myungsoo would\u2019ve killed him if he hadn\u2019t. Myungsoo lives north of the city, but half an hour later he\u2019s at their door. </p><p>\"You slipped on <i>ice</i>?\" Myungsoo laughs as soon as he\u2019s reassured himself that no, Sungyeol hasn\u2019t lost his memories and that yes, other than his wounded pride, he\u2019s alright. </p><p>\"You too?\" Sungyeol asks in disbelief. \"It was dark!\" </p><p>\"Be more careful,\" Sunggyu says. He\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table, laptop in front of him. Sungyeol\u2019s become a regular presence in their apartment again, and Sunggyu\u2019s the one who\u2019d suggested Sungyeol stay with them for a few days. </p><p>Woohyun had wanted to stay with Sungyeol for a few days, but he couldn\u2019t say that. </p><p>Sunggyu offers Sungyeol Woohyun\u2019s bed, like it\u2019s perfectly normal to offer up someone else\u2019s bed, but Woohyun would\u2019ve anyway. Woohyun says he\u2019ll take the sleeping bag, but Sungyeol glances at him, and no, Woohyun won\u2019t be using the sleeping bag and they both know it. Myungsoo leaves before the subway stops, promising that yes, he\u2019ll be careful, and yes, he\u2019ll text them when he gets home. </p><p>It isn\u2019t until the lights are off and the door\u2019s closed and Sungyeol\u2019s lying in bed that Woohyun lets loose a shuddering breath. </p><p>\"Fuck, you scared me,\" Woohyun says. He lies down next to Sungyeol, wraps his arms around him, hours of tension draining away, and Sungyeol\u2019s the one who cries easily, not him. </p><p>\"I just slipped,\" Sungyeol says. He pats Woohyun\u2019s arm, and it\u2019s so awkwardly reassuring that Woohyun has to laugh. </p><p>\"Your thick skull was good for something,\" Woohyun says. \"Myungsoo was so worried you\u2019d become amnesiac.\" </p><p>\"The first thing I\u2019d forget is you,\" Sungyeol says. After a moment: \"I didn\u2019t mean that.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"I only called you because you live close.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"I\u2026\" </p><p>\"I know,\" Woohyun says. He places his hand over Sungyeol\u2019s still resting against his arm, still resting over his heart. \"I know.\" </p><p>Sungyeol is still sleeping when Woohyun wakes, but just let him rest, he\u2019d been told. He slips out into the living room, where Sunggyu is already dressed and ready to go. </p><p>\"You\u2019re staying home?\" Sunggyu asks. </p><p>\"Yeah, I\u2019ll let them know I\u2019m working from home and remote in,\" Woohyun says. \"Myungsoo said he\u2019ll take care of things on Sungyeol\u2019s side.\" </p><p>Sunggyu nods. He pauses by the door, his hand on the door knob. </p><p>\"He\u2019s lucky to have friends like you two,\" he says. </p><p>\"Anyone\u2019s lucky to have me,\" Woohyun laughs. </p><p>He sets up camp on the couch, keeping an eye on Sungyeol through the open door to his room. </p><p>Come get me, Sungyeol had said, when Woohyun had picked up the phone. His words had been slurred, and Woohyun\u2019s heart had dropped. I fell, Sungyeol had said, and that doesn\u2019t make Woohyun feel any better. </p><p>Friends, Woohyun reminds himself. They\u2019re just friends.  </p><p>\"Woohyun?\" </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s voice is soft from his bedroom. </p><p>Woohyun nearly knocks his laptop onto the floor in his haste to stand. </p><p>\"Feeling better?\" he asks, walking\u2014walking\u2014to his room. He leans against the doorframe. </p><p>\"No,\" Sungyeol says. \"I feel like shit.\" </p><p>\"You look like shit,\" Woohyun agrees. He doesn\u2019t, not really, just a little tired, tucked under his blankets. </p><p>\"Asshole,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Takes one to know one,\" Woohyun says. \"How\u2019s your head?\" </p><p>\"It hurts,\" Sungyeol says, and Sungyeol\u2019s always been straightforward, but this is a straightforward Woohyun\u2019s not used to, a raw sort of straightforward. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll get you some Advil,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s drifted back to sleep in the few minutes it takes to find the bottle and pour a cup of water. He\u2019s half on his side, and he\u2019s burrowed deeper into the blankets. Woohyun doesn\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s cold outside. </p><p>He sleeps for the rest of the day, more or less, waking up long enough to take the Advil Woohyun left on his bedside table.  </p><p>By the third day, he\u2019s mostly awake, and generally irritable, and Woohyun feels like he could cry from relief.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\" Sungyeol says. \"Stop hovering, you\u2019re worse than my mom.\" </p><p>\"I could always call your mom,\" Woohyun says\u2014Sungyeol shudders. \"See, not worse than your mom.\" </p><p>\"At least she cooks better than you,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Says the person eating my cooking.\" </p><p>\"Better than nothing,\" Sungyeol says, but he\u2019s still tired. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t stop him from pulling Woohyun over that night, and Woohyun\u2019s body responds before his mind does. </p><p>\"You should\u2014\" be resting, Woohyun says, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been a little too reckless, and when Sungyeol kisses him, he kisses back.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The rain is incessant. </p><p>Woohyun knows he must look crazy, standing at the side of the street, no umbrella, soaked.  </p><p>But it\u2019s also the middle of the night and it\u2019s raining and this is a side street in the middle of a residential quarter and no one\u2019s crazy enough to be outside, so there\u2019s no one to see him, standing across from the apartment building he\u2019s just left, staring at the light in the window.  </p><p><i>Is this your idea of comforting me?</i> Sungyeol\u2019s face, twisted into a sneer. </p><p>Yes, no, not that\u2014<i>can\u2019t figure out how to insult me?</i>, he\u2019d said, and fucking hell Nam Woohyun what had <i>that</i> been about. Fuck, he hadn\u2019t been able to do anything. Not tonight, not last week, not last month, not ever. He wants to tell himself it\u2019s just because Sungyeol won\u2019t let him in, but that\u2019s not it either, is it? It\u2019s because Woohyun doesn\u2019t know how. Doesn\u2019t know how to comfort him, doesn\u2019t know what to say to him, doesn\u2019t know how to navigate him, doesn\u2019t know how to navigate his anger, instead of making it all worse. Doesn\u2019t know how to not say all the awful things he\u2019d said. </p><p>Sungyeol had been crying. Just before he\u2019d slammed the door, Sungyeol had been crying. </p><p>By the time the rain stops, the sun has nearly risen, and Woohyun knows he should probably go home.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Christmas songs play incessantly on the radio and in stores and in Sungyeol singing them off-tune just to piss Sunggyu off, Woohyun\u2019s pretty sure, until Sunggyu threatens to lock him out of the apartment and never let him back in. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t push him, he might actually do it,\" Woohyun laughs, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from joining in.  </p><p>Sunggyu spends a lot of the time out of the apartment anyway, and Sungyeol spends nearly as much time in their apartment as his own. There are the lingering headaches, but Sungyeol really is fine. Sungyeol also doesn\u2019t push him away when Woohyun joins him on the couch, shoulder to shoulder, nor does he shy away from Woohyun\u2019s touches. Woohyun had gone to Sungyeol\u2019s apartment when he\u2019d been out cold to get him a few sets of clothes, and they join a few stray shirts in the bottom drawer that Sungyeol had forgotten here months ago. It makes it easier for Sungyeol to go home with Woohyun after work, instead of to his own apartment. It\u2019s good he doesn\u2019t have a dog, Sungyeol says one day out of the blue, and Woohyun has no clue what he means and tells him as much. </p><p>\"Never mind,\" Sungyeol says, and it\u2019s hard to mind, when Sungyeol has his hand down Woohyun\u2019s pants. </p><p>\"I\u2019m in the middle of cooking!\" Woohyun laughs and pushes Sungyeol off. </p><p>They don\u2019t get as far as doing the dishes, before Woohyun leans over the back of the couch, leans over Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, and turns his head for a kiss. </p><p>\"I\u2026mmm\u2026was going\u2026to ask you to\u2026do\u2026the dishes,\" Woohyun says, words murmured against Sungyeol\u2019s lips in brief moments of pause. </p><p>\"Stop talking,\" Sungyeol says. His fingers tangle in Woohyun\u2019s hair, tugging lightly as they twist, his mouth still playing against Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>\"Rich, coming from you,\" Woohyun says. He lets Sungyeol pull him over, and it\u2019s awkward, hanging half off the couch. He has to push Sungyeol away, laughing, so he can sit up. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t I say to shut up?\" Sungyeol says. Woohyun loops his arms around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, smiling into Sungyeol\u2019s kiss. Sungyeol got his hair cut a few days ago, and it\u2019s unfamiliarly short when Woohyun runs his fingers through it. It\u2019ll be Christmas soon, and Woohyun knows that Sungyeol\u2019s going to spend it with his family, three hours west. It\u2019s an uncomfortable angle, leaning backwards, twisted to his left, and he rearranges them, pushing Sungyeol back, working his tongue into his mouth, shifting so he\u2019s kneeling on the couch, straddling Sungyeol\u2019s leg. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s fingers twist in his hair, and he moans when Woohyun pushes his knee against his crotch, Sungyeol grinding up shamelessly against him. The sounds he makes rush through his blood, and Woohyun grinds down against Sungyeol\u2019s thigh, his jeans uncomfortably tight.  </p><p>God, he\u2019s going to miss this, miss those noises Sungyeol makes when Woohyun kisses him like this, the sloppy way Sungyeol kisses back, whining as he pulls at Woohyun\u2019s hair. He\u2019s so damn <i>cute</i>, even when his lips are wet and swollen, and his eyes are dark as he flips Woohyun onto his back. </p><p>\"Easy there,\" Woohyun murmurs, but he drags Sungyeol down, their legs tangling as he kisses him again, and again. He bends his leg, Sungyeol hard against him. </p><p>\"Ahhh\u2026you\u2026\" Sungyeol moans, his hands fisting in Woohyun\u2019s hair, \"don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t stop\u2014\" </p><p>\"Wasn\u2019t planning on it,\" Woohyun says. He pulls away from Sungyeol\u2019s lips, kissing lightly at the side of his neck. He slides his hand down Sungyeol\u2019s back, Sungyeol arching into the touch, even as he pushes down against Woohyun\u2019s waist. </p><p>Sungyeol comes first, a long, breathy whine, as Woohyun rubs his leg against Sungyeol\u2019s crotch, and Woohyun a minute later, touching himself frantically, Sungyeol hot and heavy on top of him. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stay like that, his arm trapped between himself and Sungyeol, Sungyeol\u2019s face buried into his shoulder, the side of his neck, his hair tickling Woohyun\u2019s face. Sungyeol seems to have drifted off to sleep, or that could be Woohyun, but his arm is going painfully numb. </p><p>\"I need to do the dishes,\" he says quietly, tugging his arm free. </p><p>Sungyeol turns his head, and Woohyun brushes his hair out of his eyes. </p><p>\"They can wait,\" Sungyeol says, and settles himself a little more firmly against Woohyun. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart skips, and he swallows it down. </p><p>\"Let me put the food away, at least,\" he says, and he pushes Sungyeol off to the side, sliding off the couch. Sungyeol groans and rolls onto his side, and Woohyun gives him a pat on the head before he heads to the kitchen. </p><p>By the time Woohyun\u2019s cleaned up, Sungyeol seems to have fallen asleep entirely. He sleeps a lot more these days, he\u2019s tired a lot more these days. His chest rises and falls in slow breaths, and his body is too long for the couch, curled up with his legs bent and he still doesn\u2019t fit. His head is pillowed on one arm, and the other is held in front of him, as if holding something invisible to his chest. Woohyun swallows again. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t bother closing the door when he showers, and with his back is turned, he doesn\u2019t realise Sungyeol\u2019s in the bathroom with him until he says, \"mind if I join?\" </p><p>It\u2019s a credit to himself that he turns around slowly, and Sungyeol\u2019s shadow is behind the frosted glass, the water still so hot that it scalds his skin. A thousand things to say fly through his mind\u2014already?, good morning sleeping beauty, can\u2019t this wait, what the fuck I\u2019m showering here, I\u2019m naked go away, yes, I mind\u2014yes. </p><p>\"Nothing I haven\u2019t seen before,\" Woohyun says wryly, turning the heat down, and Sungyeol chuckles. </p><p>It\u2019s cold, as Woohyun moves aside to give Sungyeol some room, and it\u2019s true, it\u2019s nothing Woohyun hasn\u2019t seen before\u2014but not something he\u2019s seen under bright white fluorescence, open and unabashed, instead of hidden in half shadows and greyed light. And he\u2019s <i>tall</i>\u2014of course he\u2019s tall, he\u2019s always tall, but uninterrupted by the broken lines of clothes, water streaming down from his shoulders to his collar bones, waist, hips, legs\u2014he\u2019s tall. He sticks his head underneath the showerhead, and it courses down his face, hair plastered down, until he shakes it off like a dog, droplets of water hitting Woohyun. </p><p>\"You\u2019re done?\" he says to Woohyun over his shoulder, and his lips are quirked in that half laugh. </p><p>\"Done what?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Showering,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun takes the half step forward that presses his chest to his back, and wraps his arms around him, skin to skin to skin. </p><p>\"Maybe,\" Woohyun says, and there\u2019s water in his eyes as Sungyeol turns and pushes Woohyun against the shower wall. </p><p>They tumble into bed, clean, dry, hair wet and still dripping, despite the toweling. Woohyun has Sungyeol under him even before Sungyeol\u2019s near, tripping him so he falls heavily on his back against the soft mattress. No clothes, no point, and Woohyun sucks greedy marks against Sungyeol\u2019s skin until Sungyeol is writhing. But Sungyeol is Sungyeol, and Woohyun lets him, eventually, turn their positions. There\u2019s the light in the kitchen, but his room is dim, and Woohyun, briefly, thinks about turning on the lights, because he wishes he could see more clearly the way Sungyeol is looking down on him right now, his hands holding down Woohyun\u2019s shoulders, but then Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is against his, against his neck, his shoulder, his collar bones and it trails down, sucking kisses in its path. He pauses, and it\u2019s Woohyun who\u2019s whining for him not to stop, who hooks a leg around Sungyeol, Sungyeol whose mouth is suddenly hot around Woohyun\u2019s nipple and <i>shit</i> his tongue, his thoughts flee and they stay gone, Sungyeol\u2019s teeth scraping against his hip and\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol has always been impatient, takes Woohyun\u2019s entire length into his mouth, and his fingers grip Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders, then tangle in his hair, pushing him down because Sungyeol\u2019s impatient but he\u2019s also a dick and he pulls back, and Woohyun could swear he\u2019s laughing. </p><p>\"Fucking ass,\" Woohyun breathes, and Sungyeol\u2019s definitely laughing as he catches the head of Woohyun\u2019s cock in his mouth. </p><p>\"Mmhmmm,\" Sungyeol hums, and it\u2019s any guess as to what he means but it travels up his dick and <i>fuck</i>, fuck, when\u2019s the last time Sungyeol\u2019d sucked him off. A half formed quip\u2014finally putting that mouth of yours to good use\u2014but it never makes it off his tongue, he\u2019s so wound up and Sungyeol\u2019s tongue is pressed against the underside of his cock. </p><p>By the time they pull away, sweaty and out of breath, a handspan apart, facing each other on the bed, it\u2019s well into the new day. Woohyun watches as Sungyeol\u2019s eyes fall shut, too heavy with sleepiness to stay open, before he brushes his hair away from his face. He could, he thinks softly, get used to this\u2014again. </p><p>The sun, in the morning, is white and piercing, even through the closed blinds. Sungyeol is still half asleep beside him, but when Woohyun runs his hand down his arm, he turns, and he\u2019s awake. </p><p>\"Late night?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"And whose fault is that?\" Sungyeol asks, his words softened by sleep. </p><p>\"You want coffee?\" Woohyun asks, and he takes Sungyeol\u2019s half hearted nod to mean yes. </p><p>It\u2019s nearly noon, and Sungyeol follows him out some ten minutes later, a white t-shirt and sweatpants. Woohyun debates between breakfast and lunch, but at least the coffee's done by the time Sungyeol stumbles into the kitchen. He\u2019s not Sungyeol, all him and Sunggyu have is one of those cheap black drip makers, half price from one of those back to school sales, who knew how many years ago. Woohyun had meant to get something nicer, last year\u2014but he doesn\u2019t drink enough coffee, and he\u2019d never gotten around to it. Maybe he should. </p><p>Sungyeol moves around the kitchen, and Woohyun makes the rice. There\u2019s bagels in the freezer, but Sungyeol knows that, and he can get it himself, if he wants. Woohyun hums as he looks for leftovers and whatever\u2019s around to throw together for lunch, and it\u2019s a good thing they were planning on doing groceries this afternoon, because there\u2019s really not much around. </p><p>\"Here,\" Sungyeol says at one point, and Woohyun is pleasantly surprised to find Sungyeol shoving a mug of coffee at him. </p><p>\"I made enough for two?\" Woohyun frowns. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, even though Woohyun knows he hadn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t say that, though, just takes it and smiles into the coffee. </p><p>By the time he finishes putting together a meal, Sungyeol\u2019s disappeared. He finds him on his bed, and Sungyeol opens his eyes when Woohyun walks in. </p><p>\"Wow, I must\u2019ve really tired you out last night,\" Woohyun chuckles. The bed sinks under his weight, and Sungyeol sits up, yawning. He slides over to the side of the bed, and Woohyun catches him by the shoulder. Sungyeol tenses visibly, before he relaxes, and lets Woohyun pull him close. Sungyeol\u2019s still drowsy, despite the coffee, and Woohyun smiles as Sungyeol\u2019s hands are loose around his waist.  </p><p>Woohyun presses a soft kiss against Sungyeol\u2019s lips, and when he doesn\u2019t respond, he flicks his tongue out. Sungyeol\u2019s arms tighten around him, and Woohyun traces his hand up Sungyeol\u2019s back as he teases at Sungyeol\u2019s mouth with his tongue. The afternoon sun is piercing, reflecting off ice covered snow on the window sill, and Woohyun closes his eyes against the glare, slowly kissing Sungyeol until he\u2019s pressed up against him. Sungyeol\u2019s hand is pressed against his waist, and Woohyun covers it with his own, his other hand at the nape of Sungyeol\u2019s neck.  </p><p>A mark Woohyun had left the previous night is just visible where Sungyeol\u2019s shirt is a little loose, and slides off his shoulder. Woohyun runs a finger over it, and catches the same spot between his lips, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers dig into his waist as he plays against the skin with his tongue. </p><p>Sungyeol leans back, pulls away, slides away. </p><p>\"We should stop,\" he says. He glances at the door. </p><p>Woohyun frowns. \"Sunggyu\u2019s gone until Monday,\" he says, but when he leans in again, Sungyeol shakes his head. </p><p>\"That\u2019s not what I mean,\" he says, and his eyes don\u2019t meet Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>His heart goes cold, and Sungyeol\u2019s words hit him like a truck, a torrent of cold water. </p><p>\"Then why stop?\" Woohyun says, but the words sound hollow to his own ears. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t mean now\u2014\" Sungyeol says, then shakes his head in frustration. </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, just\u2026listen to me okay?\" and Sungyeol has his hands balled into fists and he\u2019s resolutely not facing Woohyun. \"Just\u2026shut up and listen\u2014fuck, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\" </p><p>\"Just say it,\" Woohyun says. He chuckles drily. \"I was hoping we weren\u2019t going to talk about this.\" </p><p>\"We should stop, take a step back,\" Sungyeol repeats, and he\u2019s still not looking at Woohyun, and he swallows. \"We never did talk\u2026about it.\" </p><p>\"And whose fault was that?\" Woohyun asks, because he remembers this, remembers asking Sungyeol, a country apart, if he wanted to Skype, if he wanted to call, but it was always too late, too early, too busy. </p><p>\"I <i>meant</i> to,\" Sungyeol says quietly, and Woohyun realises he\u2019d said that aloud, his words full of bitterness. </p><p>\"I thought you hated me,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"What?\" Sungyeol\u2019s eyes snap towards him, wide. \"Why would I ever?\" </p><p>\"Well, you did ignore me for three months,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t <i>hate</i> you,\" Sungyeol says. He looks at his hands. His voice goes so quiet, Woohyun can barely hear him. \"You\u2019re the one who should hate me.\" </p><p>Woohyun blows out a puff of frustration. \"What does that have to do with any of <i>this</i>?\" he says. \"It\u2019s been a <i>year</i>, it\u2019s a bit too late for this, isn\u2019t it?\" </p><p>\"Everything! It has everything to do with it\u2014we\u2019re not boyfriends, alright? We\u2019re not dating, we stopped!\" </p><p>I know, I know, I know, pounds in Woohyun\u2019s head.  </p><p>\"It\u2019s just <i>sex</i>,\" Woohyun says. \"We don\u2019t need to be dating for\u2014\" </p><p>\"But it\u2019s not, is it?\" Sungyeol says, and there\u2019s already the faint trace of red in his eyes. \"Not for you.\" </p><p>\"What\u2026\" </p><p>\"You\u2019d have to be blind\u2014I\u2019m not, we\u2019re not dating, we\u2019re not going to, and it\u2019s <i>not</i> just sex for you! You have feelings, and I don\u2019t want to hurt those feelings!\" Sungyeol\u2019s voice builds up into a note of hysteria, and Woohyun clutches the sheets between his fingers. </p><p>\"So what if I have feelings?\" he says flatly. </p><p>\"Look, I\u2019m going to find some nice girl, settle down, maybe you are too, we can\u2019t <i>do</i> this,\" Sungyeol says, and yeah, it\u2019s slightly hysterical now, and Woohyun\u2019s chest is so tight it feels like he\u2019s the one crushing it in his own fist. \"We need to stop, you need to stop\u2014\" </p><p>\"So you\u2019re just going to decide for us? For me?\" </p><p>\"Yeah! Yeah, I am, because I don\u2019t want to hurt you again!\" </p><p>\"And what if\u2014\" He stops, because his phone is ringing. Woohyun bites at his lip, and takes a deep breath, because even though it feels like he can\u2019t breathe, he\u2019s breathing hard. He stares at Sungyeol, and Sungyeol\u2019s cheeks are pink, and he\u2019s breathing hard too, but not because they\u2019ve just pulled away from each other after tangling on the couch. (But maybe they\u2019re pulling away from each other in another way, the same way, a different way.) The phone stops, and in the silence, his heart is loud in his own ears. His blood rushes through him, and fire prickles at his skin. A moment, and then it starts ringing again.  </p><p>\"I need to take this,\" Woohyun says hollowly. He stands, leaving Sungyeol sitting alone on the bed, staring at his hands, at the floor. </p><p>It\u2019s his mom, and he waits until he\u2019s out of the room, before he picks up. </p><p>\"Mom? Isn\u2019t this too early for you\u2014oh, right, it\u2019s afternoon already, I just woke up late, no, you didn\u2019t wake me up, I was just in the bathroom.\" Woohyun wasn\u2019t, but he is in the bathroom now, and he pulls the door shut behind him, sinking down to the floor, leaning against it. A faint sliver of light glints off the glass of the shower. </p><p>\"Have you had a chance to think about it?\" his mom asks, and Woohyun drags his hand down his face. \"I don\u2019t mean to push you, but if you\u2019ve already made a decision\u2026\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s a pretty big decision,\" Woohyun says, and he laughs a little. \"I have been thinking about it a lot.\" </p><p>\"Would it help if we talked about it? I know you talked about it with your dad too, he said that you were thinking about it\u2014Woohyun, if you did move with us, your grandma would be so happy,\" his mom says, and she sounds so hopeful that Woohyun wonders if yes, yes he could just throw away everything here, tear himself out of this life and build up a new one, how hard could it be? </p><p>But: \"I don\u2019t know, mom,\" he says. \"Korea\u2019s very far away, much further away than California.\" </p><p>\"Of course, that\u2019s why,\" his mom says.  </p><p>\"But it\u2019s like dad said\u2014if I moved with you to Korea, it\u2019ll be hard for me, but I <i>do</i> want to see everyone more.\" Woohyun settles himself a little more comfortably against the cold tile.  </p><p>\"That\u2019s right, will you be visiting soon?\" </p><p>\"California or Korea?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Here, silly,\" his mom says. \"It\u2019d be a shame if you never saw this place before we left. It\u2019s so warm and the weather\u2019s so nice\u2014I\u2019ve shown you the pictures, you can see the ocean from the bedroom!\" </p><p>\"When are you leaving?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"April or May,\" she says, and that makes sense, but it\u2019s so soon, and he\u2019s only had a month\u2014two months, more than that\u2014to think about it, and... </p><p>\"If I go,\" he says slowly, \"when should I know? When should I\u2026decide?\" </p><p>\"Oh, my child, are you thinking about it?\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know, mom,\" he says. \"I mean, I am thinking about it, I just don\u2019t know if\u2026\" he laughs a little drily. </p><p>\"February,\" she says, \"let\u2019s say February, but there\u2019s no rush, you don\u2019t need to ride on a plane with us. You\u2019re much older now.\" </p><p>There\u2019s a sound on the other side of the door, and Woohyun swallows. </p><p>(When it rains, it pours.) </p><p>\"Can we talk later?\" he says. \"My friend is here\u2014Sungyeol, from university\u2014I think he\u2019s getting a little impatient.\" </p><p>His mom laughs, and he misses her so much, so, so, much. He should tell her they should Skype, after. He wants to see her so much. </p><p>\"Of course,\" she says. \"Go have fun. You know I love you so much, right?\" </p><p>\"Me too,\" he says, and eventually, he does have to hang up. He sits with the silence for a few moments, phone warm in his hand. But Sungyeol is still on the other side of the door, and eventually, he does have to stand, and eventually, he does have to face Sungyeol. Face himself. </p><p>But: </p><p>\"You\u2019re moving to Korea?\" </p><p>Sungyeol is standing just outside the door, and his hand is on the wall, and his face is the very picture of surprise. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t someone tell you it\u2019s rude to eavesdrop?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"You\u2019re <i>moving to Korea</i>?\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know,\" Woohyun says. \"Can we talk about this later?\" </p><p>\"You\u2019ve never lived in Korea,\" Sungyeol says, and his brows are furrowed in maybe it\u2019s worry, if Woohyun squints. </p><p>\"I moved here from Korea,\" Woohyun points out\u2014when he was seven, but he still had\u2014\"and I said, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\" </p><p>\"When?\" </p><p>\"I just said I don\u2019t know, didn\u2019t I?\" Woohyun snaps. He pushes past Sungyeol and his outstretched arm. He looks at his bedroom, and then at the couch. The smell of fresh cooked rice floats out from the kitchen, and Woohyun slips his phone into his pocket. </p><p>\"We had a conversation to finish,\" Woohyun says. It sounds tired even to his own ears. A conversation a year late. </p><p>\"Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\" Sungyeol says, and his voice is accusatory, and Woohyun laughs, shaking his head in disbelief.  </p><p>\"You\u2019re kidding, right?\" Woohyun turns, snorting. Like you told me? \"Why would I tell <i>you</i>?\" </p><p>\"Because\u2026because we\u2019re <i>friends</i>,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Are we?\" Woohyun says, quietly. \"I don\u2019t know what you want us to be anymore.\" </p><p>\"Friends,\" Sungyeol says. \"I want us to be friends, don\u2019t you get it?\" </p><p>\"I did say that, didn\u2019t I? I get it, we\u2019re friends\u2014you never said why, you just\u2014\" Woohyun shakes his head in frustration. He runs his hands through his hair, paces to the couch, leans his hands against it. \"I really thought you hated me, you know? Or you got tired of me, you wouldn\u2019t be the first\u2014\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s because I\u2019m not good for you! Because all I\u2019m ever going to do is hurt you, because I\u2019m a dick, alright? I\u2026 Fucking hell, Woohyun, I <i>punched you in the face</i>.\" </p><p>\"That was just once\u2014\" </p><p>\"Are you listening to yourself?\" </p><p>\"So what, you lost your temper, call me when there\u2019s real news\u2014Sungyeol, I barely <i>remember</i> that.\" </p><p>\"Then maybe\u2014maybe I just don\u2019t like you that way,\" Sungyeol says\u2014like he\u2019s trying to convince himself, and it\u2019s so petulant, that Woohyun has to laugh. He whirls, and Sungyeol\u2019s standing in the middle of his living room, and he\u2019s so awkward and tall and not out of place enough. He\u2019s standing there, and Woohyun has never more wanted to punch someone before, never wanted to punch Sungyeol more, not even when he belittled him in front of an entire class of his students. </p><p>\"'Thank you for being born,'\" Woohyun murmurs to himself. He lets out a deep breath, and he turns around again, because he can\u2019t meet Sungyeol\u2019s eyes that aren\u2019t meeting his at all. \"You remember saying that? And I laughed because that\u2019s cheesier than anything I ever said?\" </p><p>\"That was you!\" Sungyeol says. \"I just\u2026said it back!\" </p><p>\"You meant it though, and it wasn\u2019t as friends,\" Woohyun says. \"That time, I really thought that\u2026\" </p><p>Woohyun trails off, because for brief moments, he\u2019s been thinking that again, when they were leaning against each other on the couch, when Sungyeol had his arms around Woohyun as Woohyun did the dishes, when Sungyeol would look at him, after, with eyes that could\u2019ve melted Woohyun\u2019s heart a thousand times over. </p><p>\"I <i>punched</i> you,\" Sungyeol says again, then he growls in frustration. \"Fine, I do like you, okay? And you deserve someone better!\" </p><p>\"And you get to decide who that is? You say my ego\u2019s big? What about yours?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m trying to be serious\u2014\" </p><p>\"And so am I?\"  </p><p>\"So just listen to what I\u2019m saying, damn it!\" </p><p>Woohyun scoffs. \"I am listening to you, and guess what, you don\u2019t get to decide my 'feelings'. I\u2019m the only one who gets to decide if they\u2019re hurt or\u2014\" </p><p>\"But I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to hurt you, you\u2014\" </p><p>\"What name are you going to call me now?\" Woohyun asks, because he\u2019s turned and Sungyeol has that look on his face. \"Listen to me, Lee Sungyeol, what do you want? Forget if I get hurt or not, forget\u2014\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t, you asshole! That\u2019s the whole point\u2014you don\u2019t get it, I already hurt you, didn\u2019t I? What if I had hated you? What if I <i>wanted</i> to hurt you?\" Sungyeol spits the words out, as if they're poison against his tongue. \"You want to do that again?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Maybe I\u2019m just not ready, maybe I can\u2019t do this whole relationship thing, and I\u2019m just not good for you!\" </p><p>\"Does it matter? I don\u2019t, I just\u2014you\u2019re not ready, alright,  you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good for me, fine, but what if I want to be good for you? Are you saying I\u2019m not, I can\u2019t do that?\" </p><p>\"Of course not, I\u2019m saying\u2014\" </p><p>\"Then what\u2019s the problem? What if that\u2019s what I want?\" Woohyun says, but he knows the problem, and the problem is that he\u2019s the one being selfish\u2014he knows that Sungyeol might be all barbs and thorns on the outside, but that, yeah, he\u2019s right. It couldn\u2019t have lasted, and one day Sungyeol\u2019s going to say, again, let\u2019s stop, and Woohyun will feel his heart crumple into itself, like it had last winter, and like it\u2019s doing right now, and like it had every time Sungyeol had locked him out of his life, and he\u2019s right. </p><p>He\u2019s right, because Woohyun takes things to heart, and so does Sungyeol, and he\u2019s being selfish because he knows that Sungyeol knows that and every time, it\u2019s Sungyeol who gets hurt too. But right now\u2014right now, he wants to be selfish. </p><p>\"But what if that\u2019s not what I want?\" Sungyeol asks. \"What if I really just want to stop?\" </p><p>\"Which part?\" Woohyun asks, and Sungyeol\u2019s eyes have dropped again. \"Me, or 'hurting' me?\" </p><p>Sungyeol hesitates. \"You,\" he says softly, but he still doesn\u2019t meet Woohyun\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t lie to me,\" Woohyun says. \"Don\u2019t lie to yourself.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m <i>not</i>,\" Sungyeol says, but he\u2019s always been a terrible liar, and he\u2019s always been an open book, and he knows this too. </p><p>\"You don\u2019t want to stop,\" Woohyun says slowly. \"But you don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings.\" </p><p>\"Not everything has to have feelings attached,\" Sungyeol says. He sits, folding his legs in front of him. \"Only if\u2026only if you promise that.\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t, Sungyeol,\" Woohyun says, and he knows that he should lie, here, but he\u2019s never been a good liar either. No, he\u2019s always been a good liar, he\u2019s just never been good at lying. </p><p>\"You know I can\u2019t,\" Woohyun adds, several beats later. </p><p>\"Then I don\u2019t,\" Sungyeol says. \"I don\u2019t want it. See, it\u2019s not just sex. For you.\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t,\" Woohyun pushes on, and Sungyeol\u2019s speaking into his knees, his voice thick, and Woohyun\u2019s speaking to the crown of his head, \"but pretend that I can. Please, Sungyeol\u2014I don\u2019t want to stop, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t want to go back.\" </p><p>He wants to sit next to him, wants to wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him close, but that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants, he\u2019s sure about that. (Then why, if he knows that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants, does he want this\u2014because, in a way, Sungyeol does want this, and he knows that too.) </p><p>Woohyun laughs drily. \"I\u2019ll get hurt either way, right? So at least let me get hurt and not regret anything.\" </p><p>\"What if you do regret it?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun takes a step back, and a deep breath. They tease Sungyeol, calling him a kid, and he\u2019s not, but right now, he reminds him of one. He reminds him of a kid, lost in the mall, and he doesn\u2019t know where to start looking for someone he knows. </p><p>\"I told you, didn\u2019t I? Regret or not, hurt or not, that\u2019s not for you to decide. I don\u2019t want to do anything you don\u2019t want to do\u2014but if you want to do something that I want to do\u2026\" Woohyun breathes out, sucks in air, and when he breathes out again, it\u2019s a shuddering breath that comes dangerously close to something he doesn\u2019t want to admit, and he sits as well, because his legs feel like they\u2019re going to give out under him. \"I don\u2019t want to step back, Sungyeol, and if you want this, if you want to do this without feelings, then let\u2019s do that. I\u2019m fine with that.\" </p><p>\"Even if I punch you again?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019d rather not,\" Woohyun says, \"unless I really deserve it again. I don\u2019t <i>care</i>, Yeol, it\u2019s just sex, right?\" </p><p>\"But I care, I don\u2019t want\u2026\" to hurt you, he\u2019s going to say, but Woohyun\u2019s heard that enough, and he knows that enough, and he\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s so selfish. </p><p>\"Let me pretend,\" he says. </p><p>\"What if there\u2019s some girl?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want to hurt me, but you don\u2019t mind hurting her?\" Woohyun asks, amused. </p><p>\"No, I\u2019m just saying that\u2014\"  </p><p>\"Do you have some girl?\" Woohyun asks, cutting off Sungyeol\u2019s frustration. </p><p>\"You\u2019d know if I did,\" Sungyeol glowers, and he finally raises his head, furiously wiping at his eyes with the back of his hand. </p><p>He could get him tissues, or a roll of toilet paper because they don\u2019t have tissues, but Woohyun just pulls his knees to his chest in a mirror image. \"I always was the one who wanted this,\" Woohyun says. Sungyeol glances up in surprise, and Woohyun feels his lips stretch in a half smile. \"You told me you weren\u2019t sure if you were ready for commitment, and I told you we\u2019d play it by ear\u2014so last winter, now, it\u2019s not you. Stop kicking yourself over it\u2014I know you are, I know you well enough for that.\" </p><p>\"I could say the same,\" Sungyeol says, and it\u2019s horribly choked. </p><p>Woohyun swallows, and stands. The rice is done. \"Let\u2019s eat,\" he says. \"It\u2019s getting late.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, and he hears Sungyeol stand as well, behind him. </p><p>\"Want to go play billiards after?\" Woohyun asks. \"See if Myungsoo\u2019s up for coming downtown.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t know if he wants to know what his answer is.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A cold spray mists against their faces, splashing inwards from the wall of water in front of them. The day is threatening rain, but it\u2019s humid and hot and sticky and Sungyeol just laughs with glee as he drags Woohyun up against the railing. Children shriek with delight as they do the same, pulling unwilling parents along, families posing for pictures, covered in thin plastic raincoats, toddlers hanging back as their older siblings encourage them forward. The light that filters in through the falls dances off the spray carried in with it.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m wearing a white shirt!\" Woohyun protests. </p><p>\"That\u2019s even better!\" Sungyeol says, voice raised to make himself heard as the torrential fall crashes through air and against the river below. </p><p>\"Why didn\u2019t you let us put on the ponchos again?\" Woohyun says, but Sungyeol is leaning over the railing, head and hands reaching as close to the waterfall as he can. Droplets of water drip down from the ends of his hair, and it glistens against his face. His wide mouthed laughter is contagious, and his shirt is quickly going from damp to straight up wet. Woohyun snorts, shaking his head fondly. </p><p>\"Say cheese!\" Woohyun says, snapping a picture before Sungyeol turns, then catching another as Sungyeol\u2019s head whips around, eyes wide. </p><p>\"You could\u2019ve warned me,\" he complains, but in the next moment, he has an arm around Woohyun\u2019s shoulders, and takes a picture of the both of them with his phone. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hair is soaked, and the water drips against Woohyun\u2019s face. On the screen, Sungyeol\u2019s free hand, held up in a V, blocks half of Woohyun\u2019s face. </p><p>\"You can\u2019t even see me!\" Woohyun points out\u2014then freezes, because Sungyeol on the screen has turned his head, and Sungyeol next to him\u2014his lips brush against Woohyun\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\"You could\u2019ve warned me,\" Woohyun says, after he gets over the surprise. He\u2019s looking at Sungyeol, but Sungyeol\u2019s phone is still held up at an angle, and later, Woohyun will see himself, smiling at Sungyeol with a far too sappy look on his face. His shirt <i>is</i> wet, and his shoulder, soaked from Sungyeol leaning against him, shows through the white fabric, translucent. Droplets of water catch against his lashes, and his eyes are curled in fondness. But right now, he pulls away from Sungyeol in mock annoyance. \"Jeez, you\u2019re so wet!\" </p><p>\"That just means you\u2019re not wet enough,\" Sungyeol says, and the quirk of his eyebrows is telling enough. </p><p>\"Come on,\" Woohyun says, tugging Sungyeol away to give other people a chance to take pictures behind the falls. \"You still want ice cream?\" </p><p>\"Can we go to the lower deck again?\" Sungyeol says, and he means the one where the falls roar the loudest, and where it might as well <i>be</i> raining, with how much water it throws up. Woohyun shivers from the thought, but he grabs Sungyeol\u2019s hand and leads him down the tunnels hewn into the rock. He laces their fingers together, and Sungyeol squeezes his hand back.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Woohyun\u2019s <i>pissed</i>, and he shouldn\u2019t be, but he\u2019s had it, he\u2019s done with Sungyeol ignoring his texts, ignoring his calls, ignoring his fucking concern when he\u2019s so obviously <i>miserable</i>. He\u2019s done with Sungyeol putting on that shitty happy face he\u2019s terrible at, that Myungsoo sees through just as well, that almost everyone sees through, but then when he\u2019s with Woohyun, he doesn\u2019t even try\u2014and maybe Woohyun should be flattered, if Sungyeol would only <i>look</i> at him.  </p><p>\"You really are a piece of shit, you know that?\" Woohyun snarls. \"Get over yourself, get over whatever ridiculous self pity party you\u2019re throwing yourself! I just asked what\u2019s up with your mood, so stop acting like a three year old throwing a tantrum!\" </p><p>\"And I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, alright?\" and Sungyeol\u2019s jaw is set, teeth gritted. </p><p>\"My baby nephew is more reasonable than you are,\" Woohyun goads, and there\u2019s a flash of anger in Sungyeol\u2019s eyes, and a twisted flash of satisfaction in Woohyun\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The first time Woohyun sees Sungyeol, he barely remembers him, because he\u2019s too busy projecting an air of self confidence he doesn\u2019t feel. </p><p>The first time Woohyun sees Sungyeol as Sungyeol, and not bratty kid in the first and only class he ever teaches, is when Sungyeol\u2019s laughing, head thrown back, mouth stretched unattractively, as his friend tells him a horrible joke, and they\u2019ve been studying together for months now\u2014his heart flips. </p><p>(He won\u2019t recognise the moment for what it was until months later. But maybe it was never Sungyeol. Maybe it was always the image of Sungyeol.)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol returns from his parents' after New Year's, and Woohyun hasn\u2019t spoken to him since he left after billiards, that day. </p><p>He video calls his parents, and his brother, and his grandparents, and after, he gets into the shower and lets the water stream down his face, washing it all away. Woohyun spends Christmas with Myungsoo\u2019s family, and they feed him well, like they always do, and they call him charming and he tells them that Myungsoo is lucky to have such a wonderful family. Kibum goes on vacation with a couple friends of his from university, and the office is echoingly empty in those days between Christmas and New Years, as they always are. </p><p>The streets are crowded and excited as he walks home from work, the day after Christmas. He takes a detour north to the main street, and walks along the window displays, strung bright with lights and festively decorated mannequins. He walks past the intersection where Sungyeol had fallen, the concrete building housing the department store with the steps, and the big library\u2019s a bit further down the world\u2019s longest street, and the glass windows of the bank across the street reflect the crowds that surge through the intersection, when the lights stop the cars and open up the streets for the pedestrians. Woohyun lingers before he continues onwards, past the fancy hotels, the bookstore, the Gucci and the Hermes and the rest of the stores for clientele with far more cash to throw around than he\u2019ll probably ever have. The museum to his left stands in all its crystal glory, shards of some glass spaceship growing out of the stately stone building below. The buildings grow into a mix of brick and glass, the school across the street a remnant of the early 1900s with its stone columns and rounded front. His mind wanders, as he pushes alone through the crowds. It\u2019s not a cold day, and it draws people out into the late afternoon. It\u2019s only when it lets up, does he realise he\u2019s at the subway station\u2014Sungyeol\u2019s station. It was a white Christmas, and the park across the street is filled with children\u2019s delighted shrieks, flying down the flattest parts of the steep hill in plastic sleds. It\u2019s getting late\u2014he gets on the subway, and rides it all the way home. </p><p>\"Please make up with Sungyeol before you make my life miserable.\" Sunggyu corners him a few days into the new year. </p><p>\"What?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol isn\u2019t nearly as quiet as he thinks he is,\" Sunggyu says darkly. \"And neither are you.\" </p><p>\"Wait <i>what</i>?\" </p><p>\"What I\u2019m saying is, take care of whatever this cloud you have is about\u2014I\u2019d rather have the two of you singing shitty Christmas carols,\" Sunggyu says, and leaves Woohyun standing in the kitchen, too shocked to retort that Christmas carols were a perfectly apt representation of love and joy. </p><p>His brother messages him one day\u2014are you coming? he wants to know, and Woohyun asks if he\u2019s awake to talk. </p><p>\"Are you really going to? Mom thinks you are,\" he says. </p><p>\"What would you do, hyung?\" </p><p>\"Well, I\u2019m here now, aren\u2019t I?\" </p><p>\"Yeah, but that was <i>high school</i>\u2014I have a job, friends\u2026\" </p><p>\"I had friends too,\" his brother points out. There\u2019s a long pause. \"I know, it\u2019s not the same at all.\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t\u2026\" Woohyun hesitates, his teeth catching on his lip. \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in.\" </p><p>\"You? You\u2019ve always been the good one at fitting in,\" his brother says. </p><p>\"Fake it until you make it,\" Woohyun chuckles. And then: \"I\u2019ve spent too much time here to ever be truly Korean.\" </p><p>\"That doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" his brother says, and then, quietly: \"but you\u2019ll never be truly anything,\" and Woohyun remembers his brother saying that years ago, and not knowing what he\u2019d meant. He thinks he knows, a little, now. </p><p>\"Thanks, hyung. I guess I\u2019d rather think of it as being a bit of everything.\" </p><p>But still, the image of home beckons. A home he doesn\u2019t remember, a home that hasn\u2019t been his for as long as he can remember, except for visits over the summer that became increasingly sparse as he\u2019d grown older, and as he began spending summers with friends and things that\u2019d look good on his resume. And then he was working, or he was taking classes, and it becomes relegated to a week here and there, every few years\u2014last year was the longest since he\u2019d been in middle school, and he\u2019d been painfully aware of the differences in his clothes, in his speech, in the smallest ways of thinking and habits. But still. </p><p>(It\u2019s a nostalgia that\u2019s never been his, but he clings to it nevertheless.) </p><p>They run into each other one day, Woohyun leaving the hair salon, Sungyeol carrying take-out. </p><p>\"Hey,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Hey.\" </p><p>\"How were your holidays?\" </p><p>\"They were alright. You?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol, about last time\u2014\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s fine,\" Sungyeol says. \"Let\u2019s just pretend it never happened.\" </p><p>Woohyun snorts, shaking his head. \"It doesn\u2019t work like that,\" he says. And then: \"you think there\u2019s enough there for the two of us?\" </p><p>Sungyeol looks at the take-out container he\u2019s holding, and then back at Woohyun. \"Probably,\" he says, and Woohyun takes that as a yes\u2014and Sungyeol takes that as a yes. </p><p>The door hasn\u2019t even closed before Woohyun\u2019s pushing Sungyeol up against it, and it clicks shut with a sudden stop. Woohyun tangles his fingers in Sungyeol\u2019s hair, and it\u2019s a song that\u2019s been played too many times, kissing him hungrily, like it\u2019s been a year instead of a month. Bad life decisions, he thinks, but it\u2019s hard to when he\u2019s pressed his leg against Sungyeol, and Sungyeol is grinding up against him. It\u2019s been a month, but Woohyun has never felt more desperate, and he fumbles with the buttons on Sungyeol\u2019s coat, before he gives up and fumbles with the button on Sungyeol\u2019s jeans. Sungyeol moans at the touch, and his fingers push away Woohyun\u2019s, finishing the job much sooner. Woohyun mouths at Sungyeol\u2019s neck, but his hand\u2019s already down Sungyeol\u2019s pants. </p><p>\"Shit\u2014cold,\" Sungyeol hisses. Woohyun wraps his fingers around Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and he ignores Sungyeol\u2019s fingers digging into the back of his neck. Hurts like hell, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been like that, just like how he ruts up into Woohyun\u2019s hand anyway, and he\u2019s hot and heavy and Woohyun will never get tired of the sounds Sungyeol makes, the one that says don\u2019t stop, the one that says faster, the one that says please, please, please, without any words at all.  </p><p>Sungyeol comes into his hand, and Woohyun works him through it, until Sungyeol leans against him, spent. Lazily, slowly, he does the same for Woohyun, until they\u2019re both boneless and loose. </p><p>It\u2019s not quite enough for two, because Sungyeol hadn\u2019t gotten enough for two. </p><p>A song with a chorus played too many times, Sungyeol joining him after he showers\u2014he\u2019d let Woohyun go first, citing work he had to tie up\u2014in his bed.  </p><p>The lights are off, but it\u2019s better that way, Sungyeol running his hands along Woohyun\u2019s body, his fingers thin and cool. They catch on the ridges of his spine, until it cups the back of Woohyun\u2019s neck. Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is hot against his, and his body is hot against him, even though the water still damp in Sungyeol\u2019s hair is cool against him. The heat floods his body, floods his mind, and Sungyeol\u2019s hard against his thigh, and Woohyun wonders why he\u2019d bothered getting dressed after his shower at all. </p><p>(Woohyun had too, because Woohyun knows not to hope.) </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s lips are wet and slick when Woohyun draws back just enough to take a deep breath, because they both need it, and his eyes shine in the darkness. This time, Woohyun uses a bit more teeth than necessary, and there\u2019s a quiet hiss as Sungyeol pulls away, and Woohyun\u2019s shoulders shake in quick laughter. His face is flushed\u2014Woohyun\u2019s own chest is tight, and his head is already dizzy with a need for air. Sungyeol\u2019s fingers dig into Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, and in one quick moment, Sungyeol has Woohyun pressed back against the bed, his head scraping against the wall. He\u2019s staring down at him, and Woohyun pulls him down\u2014Sungyeol kisses him hungrily, and Woohyun whines, grinding up against Sungyeol, but Sungyeol has one knee on him, and Woohyun has only empty air. </p><p>His tongue is in his mouth, exploring it as if he\u2019s never done this before. Sungyeol\u2019s hand runs down his arm, and then against his chest, his thumb teasing him where he\u2019s most sensitive. Woohyun needs to <i>breathe</i> but Sungyeol holds him down, even as he tries to pull away for air. Sungyeol smells of shampoo, and he\u2019s so hot against him, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers bruise against his shoulder\u2014Woohyun shoves, really shoves, gasping. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s chest is heaving, and Woohyun\u2019s is too.  </p><p>\"You dick,\" Woohyun breathes. </p><p>\"I know,\" Sungyeol says, and then his mouth is at the side of Woohyun\u2019s neck, kissing greedy marks into his skin until Woohyun is writhing, and he wishes he could turn the light on because he wishes he could see more clearly the way Sungyeol is looking down on him right now, his hands holding down Woohyun\u2019s shoulders. Woohyun wraps an arm around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, pulls up close enough to suck at the crook of his neck, and god, the sounds Sungyeol makes, and he closes his teeth lightly over it, and he knows it\u2019ll leave a mark. Sungyeol pulls away, gasping, and Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches as Sungyeol presses himself against him, and his tongue is wet and hot against Woohyun\u2019s skin. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s hands roam Sungyeol\u2019s body, and Sungyeol whines at the touch, whines for more, and Woohyun obliges. Sungyeol grinds against his leg, and Sungyeol is so warm and solid. And then he\u2019s pushing his knee between Woohyun\u2019s legs and Woohyun whines in surprise, and Sungyeol does it again, and again, his mouth still hot against his, and his fingers clench about Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders and he pushes him away, because he wants to so badly, but he wants this to last.  </p><p>He knows he\u2019s wet, and it\u2019s absurd how wet he is, and he can feel it against the fabric of his underwear. He brings his hand down, palms Sungyeol, and Sungyeol is too\u2014Sungyeol sucks in a sharp breath, and Woohyun wraps his fingers around the bulge and squeezes just once, just enough for Sungyeol to buck up against him, but not enough for anything more. </p><p>The dark light of a city half asleep is filtering in through the window, and it\u2019s all that he can see Sungyeol by, when he opens his eyes, sees Sungyeol with his face buried in his shoulder, and Woohyun kisses at his jaw, trailing up, tongue flickering against his ear, catching his piercings in his mouth, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers tighten against him. He plays with it, until the cold metal is warm and hot and Sungyeol\u2019s trying to push up against him but Woohyun holds him down, hand on his hip, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t know how he keeps it together, how he keeps himself tangled up and cohesive and just conscious enough to know how to touch Sungyeol so he\u2019s whining into him and on the edge and so he feels <i>good</i>, but maybe that\u2019s just something he\u2019s learned and can never forget, like riding a bike or breathing underwater.  </p><p>Sungyeol pulls away, and he\u2019s flushed hot, and he draws back just enough for Woohyun to see the want gleaming in his eyes, and Woohyun leans up, catches Sungyeol in a quick kiss, but Sungyeol has other ideas.  </p><p>He pushes Woohyun down, his mouth against his, his neck, his shoulder, his collar bones, trailing kisses down his body and Woohyun hooks a leg around Sungyeol, begging him not to stop. He pauses, and Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is suddenly hot around Woohyun\u2019s nipple and <i>shit</i>, his tongue\u2014his thoughts flee and they stay gone, Sungyeol\u2019s teeth scraping against his hip, and\u2014  </p><p>shit, his tongue plays at the head of Woohyun\u2019s cock, teasing at the slit. Woohyun\u2019s fingers tangle into Sungyeol\u2019s hair, twisting it, until Sungyeol whines and reaches up with one hand, closing his fingers around Woohyun\u2019s wrist, but his lips close around just the tip, and Woohyun has to bite back his moan. </p><p>\"There\u2019s no one here,\" Sungyeol murmurs against him. \"Let me hear you,\" and Woohyun does, because it\u2019s so hard not to, and in this moment, he wants Sungyeol to, just as much and he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s been this loud, and Sungyeol drags it out of him, tongue pressing against the underside of his cock, and Woohyun bucks up into his mouth, pulling him so close that Sungyeol gags. </p><p>\"Fucking ass,\" Sungyeol breathes, as soon as he manages to pull away, and Woohyun laughs a breathy laugh, but it turns into something much more wanton, because his dick is in Sungyeol\u2019s mouth, and his world explodes. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Woohyun wakes to the unmistakable smell of coffee, rich and earthy, and the half of a bed long since empty, judging from how cool the covers are. He lies there for a moment, and then another. It\u2019s still early in the morning, and the sky is overcast, the light that filters in grey. It\u2019ll snow today, the weather forecast had said, but it seems uncertain if it\u2019s two centimeters or ten. </p><p>He hesitates, but he can\u2019t stay there forever, curled up under Sungyeol\u2019s blankets, in Sungyeol\u2019s bed. He sits up silently, the blood rushing from his head, his vision darkening for a moment, before Sungyeol\u2019s room is brought back into sharp focus. The carpet is soft against his feet, and Woohyun gets dressed in the same clothes he\u2019d been wearing last night, neatly folded in the corner of the room. He tosses the clothes he\u2019d slept in into Sungyeol\u2019s laundry bin. A thought crosses his mind\u2014he crouches down, pulls open the bottom drawer, and smiles when he sees his old clothes there. He pushes it shut, as quietly as he can. </p><p>\"Good morning,\" he says, as he walks to the kitchen. </p><p>Sungyeol turns, eyes sharp, and Woohyun\u2019s heart plummets\u2014but then he breaks into a smile. \"Took you long enough,\" he says. \"The coffee\u2019s nearly cold.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s what microwaves are for,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol snorts in contempt. </p><p>There\u2019s the clear attempts of breakfast on the counter, and Woohyun stifles a laugh. He reaches for the messy plate of pancakes, but Sungyeol hastily slaps his hand away. </p><p>\"I mixed up the salt and sugar,\" he says sheepishly. \"Let\u2019s just have toast.\" </p><p>\"Fine with me,\" Woohyun says. He reaches for his cup, the same one he always uses when he\u2019s here. It matches Sungyeol\u2019s, a little, and Woohyun\u2019s always liked that. </p><p>The snow\u2019s started outside, sparse flakes, barely noticeable. It lends a spark to the otherwise grey melancholy of a cold winter day, and Woohyun wanders to the window, coffee in hand. Sungyeol follows him, the bread in the toaster. </p><p>\"You forgot your umbrella here,\" he says\u2014what umbrella, Woohyun says, but Sungyeol nods towards a black umbrella, folded and leaning against the wall near the door, and oh, that umbrella. </p><p>\"I thought you\u2019d stolen it,\" Woohyun jokes, and Sungyeol glowers at him. </p><p>Woohyun washes his mug after breakfast, and Sungyeol sees him to the door. It\u2019s cold, and Woohyun wraps his scarf tightly about him, until it covers the bottom half of his face. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, as Woohyun opens the door. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. He pauses, and Sungyeol\u2019s hand is awkward at his side. \"You\u2019re coming for my birthday thing next week?\" </p><p>\"Sure,\" Sungyeol says, and then he grins. \"Don\u2019t expect a present, though.\" </p><p>\"I never expect anything,\" Woohyun laughs, and when he walks outside, across the street from an apartment building he\u2019s just left, he thinks there\u2019s a flutter of movement by the window. </p><p>It\u2019s snowing, and Woohyun\u2019s holding a black umbrella. He knows he looks ridiculous, but he props it open anyway, trailing footsteps in the snow.</p></div>\n        <!-- end cache -->\n    </div>\n<!--/chapter-->\n\n    <!--afterword-->\n    <div class=\"afterword preface group\">\n        <!--work endnotes-->\n<div id=\"work_endnotes\" class=\"end notes module\">\n  <h3 class=\"heading\">Notes:</h3>\n  <blockquote class=\"userstuff\"><p>thank you for your friendship that has made my life so much richer\u2014i've never regretted a single moment. and thank you to my dearest meimei, who's held your useless jiejie's hand through every step of this, for far more than only this fic.</p><hr /><p>\n  <small></small>\n  <br />\n  <small>location notes:</small>\n  <br />\n  <small></small>\n  <br />\n  <small>The fic generally happens along two main streets: Bloor, between approximately Church St and Christie; Yonge, from Bloor, down to Eatons center, or Yonge-Dundas square.

class=\"userstuff\">\n      <p>\n  <small>Hello and welcome to The Fic. First, some warnings: this is historical fantasy, set post Three Kingdoms Era, and has all the warnings expected of the era. This was also conceived as a 'love letter' to the historical dramas I grew up on, and has all the warnings expected of the genre. This includes but is not limited to: graphic depictions of violence, dubious/non-consent including of minors, terminal illness, and people dying. There will be no major character death. You may find <a href=\"https://questingly.dreamwidth.org/6402.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">extended notes on my dw here</a>. Particularly in regards to names! Extended notes may be updated as it goes. In the theme of a 'cdrama fic', each chapter/episode is ~4000-5000 words long, and will follow a posting schedule of Saturdays.</small>\n</p><p>\n  <small>Some notes on names:  The names were taken from the Chinese reading of their Hanja, and in the case of Taekwoon (\u90d1\u6cfd\u8fd0/Zheng Zeyun) and Jaehwan (\u674e\u5728\u7115/Li Zaihuan), modified to fit a familial naming scheme and are listed as Zheng Zhiyuan and Zheng Zhihuan respectively. Similarly, Hakyeon became Cha Xueyan (\u5b66\u6c87), Hongbin stayed Hongbin (\u5f18\u5f6c), Wonsik became Yuanzhi (\u5143\u690d), and Sanghyuk became Xianhe (modified from \u76f8\u7200/Xianghe). Reflecting its roots, I'll also be posting an epub or pdf version with the 'original' names, updated as this fic is updated.</small>\n</p><p>\n  <small>There are so many people I would need to thank, but endless thanks to panpan and isa for your endless support and encouragement. This would not exist without you.</small>\n</p><p>\n  <small>Lastly, there will be (as in any good historical cdrama/fantasy book) a plethora of characters of various importance. This <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CgQ_mS7JStlOjCC3S1mVArDqj6ATi6Q/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">dramatis personae</a> may be helpful with the royal family (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fk2YrIg4D4DPZZaIBC4_JuoQft9lAUsD/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">in order of appearance</a>, updated as needed). See extended notes for further details.</small>\n</p><p>\n  <small>Please look kindly on me, and I hope that this will bring at least a morsel of enjoyment.

The clouds failed to obscure the desperate cries of dying horses and dying men. The world was doused in dull shadows. Men were still fighting, desperate to avoid slaughter. Death was their fate. It was written. All that was left to such dead men was to bring as many enemies with them when their time came to fall. </p>\n  <p>Crouched in a dale, the youngest prince of Lan, barely twenty years old, thought of his lovely wife and their small child. His wife who\u2019d clung to him and begged him not to go. Men died around him, but all he saw was his wife\u2019s soft lips trembling in fear, her pleading eyes wet with tears.</p>\n  <p>His dearest heart had been right. What had they thought to gain?</p>\n  <p>They had thought the Empire of Jiang was still weak. That this was the best chance to take back what their Kingdom of Lan had once lost. Land that hadn\u2019t belonged to Lan in decades. The young prince of Lan\u2019s king father was an ambitious man, and there\u2019d be no better opportunity. Jiang had been drained by years of fighting, their borders besieged on all fronts. There was a new Emperor on the throne\u2014because blood had been spilled and spilled liberally. Jiang had lost many great men, both common and royal. The new Emperor\u2019s father, brothers, cousins, uncles among them. Fewer had been spared than lost. Was it not a given that their forces were stretched thin, that their state affairs must be in disarray, and they would never anticipate being attacked by Lan.</p>\n  <p>The Kingdom of Lan would be restored to glory, and the King of Lan would be the one to do it.</p>\n  <p>But then the Emperor himself had come.</p>\n  <p>A rider fell to an arrow startlingly nearby, so close that when the poor soldier dropped off his horse, his body tumbled in a slump to where the youngest prince of Lan hid. Fear suddenly gripped the young prince of Lan. A fear he hadn\u2019t known since the first time he\u2019d ridden off to battle with his older brothers to quell a small domestic uprising. A fear deeper than that fear, because now he had a family and death beckoned like it\u2019d never been before. He could die, but his beautiful, lovely, kind and gentle wife and their babe\u2014he could save them. He <i>would</i> save them and then gladly fall on the sword himself.</p>\n  <p>He was on the dead man\u2019s horse and galloping home before the thought had fully formed. He\u2019d send them away. He needed to see them one last time. He needed to hold his wife one more time in his arms and apologise for being a fool, and thank her for the days they\u2019d shared and pray fate would smile more kindly on their next life.</p>\n  <p>The ground flew by underneath him, and he swore on their ancestors that he would make this right. He would keep his young family safe.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n  </div>\n  <!--/main-->\n\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- end of cache -->\n\n    </div>\n\n\n    </div>\n    <!-- END work skin -->\n  </div>\n  <!-- END work -->\n\n  <!-- BEGIN comment section -->\n  <!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.

Not because of the method or the situation, but because it was\u2014</p>\n    <p>\"A phoenix,\" Taekwoon repeated. \"A baby phoenix.\" Wonsik fancied he could hear Taekwoon\u2019s raised eyebrows in his voice without needing to look\u2014he waved Taekwoon away to investigate before he could further raise the ire of Lady Cheon, who was simultaneously distraught and extremely, extremely upset. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik listened to her with a purposely grave expression on his face, filing her voice to the back of his mind. In one corner of the small courtyard they now stood in, there was a very large cage, conspicuously empty except for a pile of hay in one corner. It was, Lady Cheon supplied, the\u2014former\u2014home of a baby phoenix with splendid gold feathers, and that would grow into a majestic creature of splendor, and had been brought from lands even beyond the lands beyond the ocean. Wonsik pushed her voice even further to the back of his mind.</p>\n    <p>He was also sure she wouldn\u2019t be getting her 'phoenix' back, even if he and Taekwoon applied all their investigative powers and then some. Just as a wall sized painting, five ancient vases, a stone tablet of historical significance, two small statues that had been magnetically paired, a clock\u2014among several other things that were either worth absolutely nothing or were absolutely priceless that Wonsik recalled but couldn\u2019t be bothered to name\u2014would never be returning to their owners.</p>\n    <p>With each and every messenger pigeon or visit from a petty messenger detailing a theft that 'may be of Young Master Wonsik\u2019s interest', Wonsik regretted agreeing taking on this case more and more.</p>\n    <p>\"Ma\u2019am,\" Wonsik interrupted, allowing a good half second of small vindication at the way Lady Cheon\u2019s mouth hung open at being addressed in such a manner before continuing smoothly. \"Your servant Kim Wonsik regrets to inform you that neither Young Master Taekwoon nor I are paid for our services and as such we can not presume to be honoured servants of the court. We are here by the personal request by the esteemed Eleventh Prince, who has, without a doubt, the greatest sense of judgement in such cases.\"</p>\n    <p>Her change in demeanour as she recalled exactly who she was speaking to was incredibly rewarding. When he drew himself to his full height, he was a good head taller than her. While he lacked Taekwoon\u2019s sharp features, Wonsik was still, by most accounts, a handsome young man and well built. There was no doubt his status was higher than hers, although Wonsik really could have stood to be more polite. He blamed it on the lack of sleep, and prolonged proximity to Taekwoon, who was well within earshot and barely withholding laughter. </p>\n    <p>\"I would like to investigate the scene,\" Wonsik said. He placed his hands together and bowed, just enough to be polite. \"Now, if Lady Cheon will excuse me.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, yes, of course, please,\" she said, gathering her composure. Wonsik bowed to hide a smile, and turned to walk towards Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>\"'<i>Ma\u2019am</i>'?\" Taekwoon\u2019s mouth was pursed tight as he swallowed his laughter, his brows quirking upwards.</p>\n    <p>\"You\u2019re rubbing off on me,\" Wonsik said under his breath.</p>\n    <p>\"I have never said that before in my life,\" Taekwoon said, a little too proud. Taekwoon's greatest amusement in life seemed to be derived from annoying people, like a very young child. Wonsik gave him a disdainful look before he could catch himself. Taekwoon really was rubbing off on him. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik shook his head to himself and began pacing, tapping his fan against his palm as he looked. There were the faint marks of muddy footprints\u2014it had rained last evening\u2014that had been left deliberately as they lead to two separate roofs, but came from nowhere that could be seen. He was faintly aware that Taekwoon had wandered off again to do the same thing but ignored him, at least until Taekwoon had walked up behind him and rested his chin on Wonsik\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n    <p>\"You're looking for this?\" Taekwoon said. He held out a folded and slightly crumpled sheet of paper. \"It was under the hay.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik snatched the paper from him. \"Was there anything else?\" he asked as he unfolded it.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Was there anything else?</i>\" Taekwoon echoed. He straightened, lifting his bony chin off of Wonsik's shoulder. \"Were you expecting something? Another cross-stitched flower?\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, of course not,\" Wonsik said. In beautiful calligraphy but almost childishly simple writing: <i>it's just a chicken once you wash off all the gold paint! but keep it a secret\u2014let's not embarrass the lady, and a chicken isn't a very impressive thing to steal. work hard wonsik, maybe next time! sorry about the food, stealing is hungry work!</i>. He\u2019d forgotten that a basket of steam buns had also disappeared, as well as a plate of sweets. Wonsik sighed, tracing his finger over the character for 'fate' that their thief had taken to signing their letters with.</p>\n    <p>\"He\u2019s taunting you,\" Taekwoon said. Wonsik nodded absentmindedly. \"And you <i>like</i> it.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It just makes it more interesting!\" Wonsik protested. He folded the paper and stuffed it into his sleeve, tucking his fan back into his belt. Taekwoon simply arched his eyebrows. </p>\n    <p>\"A murder would be more interesting,\" Taekwoon said. \"Why hasn't anyone been murdered lately.\"</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Taekwoon.</i>\"</p>\n    <p>\"At least we can solve a murder,\" Taekwoon said. Wonsik resisted the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose. </p>\n    <p>Not the least because Taekwoon was right.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\"I heard your thief got away again,\" Jaehwan said, grinning far too brightly.</p>\n    <p>\"He's not <i>my</i> thief,\" Wonsik groaned.</p>\n    <p>Behind them, water flowed down and over the sheer rock face, pooling in a small pond that trickled away into a river that ran beneath the bridge they stood on. They were cast in shade, the sun barely visible over the rocks as it slipped in and out behind heavy clouds. A small copse of trees stood at the end of the bridge, a splash of green in the grays of rocks and water. The most brilliant colour, however, was the rich silk robe that Jaehwan wore, a deep red. It looked, as did everything, very good on him. The Eleventh Prince was slight of build, but nearly as tall as Wonsik. A jade pendant hung off the belt around his narrow waist, similar to Wonsik's own, but of finer quality stone, as befitting his status. He had a high, sharp nose, one that could be said to be almost foreign looking. In combination with his bright eyes and strong jaw, Jaehwan's profile was striking, and the Eleventh Prince could not be said to be anything but handsome. It made Wonsik a little envious.</p>\n    <p>He sighed, running a hand back through his hair.</p>\n    <p>\"Agreeing to this was a mistake,\" Wonsik said. \"I know the investigation bureau can direct any unusual thefts directly to me without going through you, but it can be a little too much.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Hey, the faster you can get to the scene the better,\" Jaehwan said. \"<i>I\u2019m</i> doing you a favour.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Who\u2019s doing who the favour?\" Wonsik grumbled.</p>\n    <p>\"You are,\" Jaehwan admitted, although his smile was far from contrite. </p>\n    <p>\"Please tell me if anyone turns up dead,\" Wonsik said, not quite believing he was saying it. \"Taekwoon\u2019s starting to get insufferable. Even the simplest death will do.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Ugh, that grumpy cat. Of course he\u2019s waiting for someone to die.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I almost can't blame him,\" Wonsik said. \"The most difficult case we've had in weeks has been my thief, and you know how that one's been going.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You said it, your thief,\" Jaehwan crowed.</p>\n    <p>\"Only because you pushed them onto me,\" Wonsik spluttered. He sighed. \"Don\u2019t tell Taekwoon, but I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it\u2014I know, I know, upholding the law\u2014never mind, forget I said anything.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Mm,\" Jaehwan hummed. His brows drew slightly downwards as he stepped forward, resting his hands on the railing of the bridge. \"We should get together properly soon, we haven\u2019t done that in <i>weeks</i>.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Did you miss me?\" Wonsik laughed, letting it taper off into a smile that itself fell away into something quieter. \"Yeah. Tomorrow night?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Magistrate Kim left three days ago, I heard,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"The residence is emptier already,\" Wonsik said. \"But my father had to return.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It\u2019s been ten years now?\" Jaehwan glanced at Wonsik, and Wonsik nodded slowly.</p>\n    <p>\"You remembered?\" It was Jaehwan\u2019s turn to nod, followed with a small shrug, as if to say 'of course'. Wonsik felt warmth swell in his heart, and had to swallow as heat unexpectedly prickled at his eyes. He sighed, stepping up to stand shoulder to shoulder with Jaehwan. \"She would\u2019ve been twenty and married now.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Maybe to me,\" Jaehwan said. He grinned, wide and crooked.</p>\n    <p>\"I would never let her step <i>near</i> you,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"But if I\u2019d married your sister then we\u2019d be brothers,\" Jaehwan said. \"You\u2019d be the brother of a prince.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I\u2019d pass,\" Wonsik said. </p>\n    <p>Jaehwan laughed again, softer this time. \"But no, no murders lately. You know I always give you the interesting cases.\"</p>\n    <p>The shadows cast over the water grew suddenly sharp again as the sun pushed aside the curtain of clouds, and jewels seemed to sparkle on the surface, past the shadows.</p>\n    <p>\"Even un-interesting ones,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Nothing but pointless squabbles among the common rabble,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"Don\u2019t call them that,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan's lips twitched, his shoulders lifting in a small shrug. Wonsik sighed again, knowing that Jaehwan was unlikely to have his mind changed on that any time soon. It was what came of being both royal, and spoiled, Wonsik supposed. It was hard to not spoil Jaehwan\u2014Wonsik had only known him for three years, but he could easily imagine Jaehwan as a child. Heck, Wonsik wanted to spoil him even now, and Jaehwan was <i>older</i> than him. But for all of Jaehwan's opinions on commoners, he wasn't an unfair bailiff\u2014the Emperor could have made worse choices. Besides, Jaehwan had a keen mind, was good at picking apart crimes and passing as fair a judgement as any. Yes, Wonsik had decided, Jaehwan was a good choice.</p>\n    <p>\"Look at us, the greatest minds in our great city\u2014nay, our great kingdom\u2014reduced to searching for lost dogs and uncatchable thieves,\" Jaehwan said, spreading his hands dramatically.</p>\n    <p>\"He is not uncatchable,\" Wonsik countered. He paused and frowned. \"Or she.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It was a very pretty flower,\" Jaehwan said, nodding sagely. \"Exquisitely fine needlework. They must have very pretty fingers, whoever they are.\"</p>\n    <p>\"What does pretty fingers have to do with anything?\" Wonsik frowned deeply.</p>\n    <p>\"The image, of course!\" Jaehwan said. \"Sitting by the window, the sun cast against her hair as she threads the needle through\u2014it's not a perfect image unless she has pretty fingers.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Or he,\" Wonsik said. They <i>had</i> said they were handsome. That'd been four thefts ago, a vase of dried flowers, possibly the least valuable thing in the entire house. It hadn't even been an <i>old</i> vase. They had not only called themselves handsome, but had also compared Wonsik to a bouquet of flowers, only manlier. Taekwoon had nearly had a laughing fit on the spot\u2014he'd ended up looking incredibly constipated instead.</p>\n    <p>\"Can't you make up your mind?\" Jaehwan whined. \"I can't decide if I want to like them or not.\"</p>\n    <p>\"He, or she, is a thief,\" Wonsik said flatly.</p>\n    <p>\"Who writes you letters and leaves you gifts. And they called you <i>handsome</i>. Wow. He's <i>courting</i> you,\" Jaehwan said. The same smug smile was back.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon has pretty fingers,\" Wonsik interrupted, before Jaehwan could expand on the thought. This conversation was veering in a very dangerous direction. His words had their intended effect, judging from Jaehwan's immediate grimace.</p>\n    <p>\"Ugh,\" Jaehwan said very coherently. Wonsik chuckled at Jaehwan's scrunched up nose.</p>\n    <p>The sound of water filled the brief silence, Wonsik catching his sleeves in his hands as he stood a moment in thought. </p>\n    <p>\"He's committing crimes that deserve death now, isn't he,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>There was a pause, a tilt of Jaehwan's head, but it was not of true consideration because the answer was clear. The law, sometimes, was very clear\u2014unless one were both rich and important, and a common thief was not. A common thief could be expected to be treated even more fairly, if fair was harsh. \"Yes,\" Jaehwan said. He shrugged. \"After so many? Without a doubt.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Here, take a look at this,\" Wonsik said, half wishing he'd never brought it up. His father was a magistrate\u2014Wonsik only knew the law too well. He handed Jaehwan a small scroll, done up very prettily.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan's frown turned into something more contemplative as he took it. Wonsik had read it over enough times to have memorised the elegant poem inside.</p>\n    <p>It was written in undoubtedly the same hand as every note left so far by his thief, but the childish language had given way to clever words. There was no sign off, but the sender was clear.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>The wind bends the shadow of the nine sons of the dragon, as the sun battles with the moon. Frost silvers the home of pine and bamboo, bending before the wind.</i> A riddle?\" Jaehwan looked up at Wonsik, eyes already sparkling in challenge. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik nodded. He moved to stand beside Jaehwan, running a finger along the first row of each of the four lines. It had been Taekwoon who had pointed out it wasn't a riddle in the meaning of the words, but a riddle made of the words themselves. Two more verses followed\u2014time, place, name, hidden somewhere in the twelve lines. </p>\n    <p>\"The new moon,\" Wonsik said. They were pretty sure on that one, especially since their thief had helpfully included the hint in the second line. A soft question, an easy start. \"That's in five days. I thought you could help shed some light on this before then.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Hm, a hint from your thief?\" Jaehwan asked, without looking up from the text.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes,\" Wonsik admitted. He moved onto the second verse, drawing out a line that looked promising. \"A temple in the east, maybe.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It could be,\" Jaehwan agreed, squinting at the words.</p>\n    <p>\"You can keep it\u2014I've made a copy. Probably more interesting than the missing dog,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Turns out the neighbours ate it,\" Jaehwan said absentmindedly. Wonsik winced. He'd always had a fondness for dogs.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>It wasn't long before Taekwoon's wish was granted.</p>\n    <p>The sky was clear, but the moon was the barest sliver. It was almost eerie, the only light coming from the lanterns, bright yet wavering. Wonsik stifled a yawn, resisting the urge to lean back against the wall. He ran his eyes over the scene, skimming only briefly over Taekwoon hunched over the body, the puddle of blood beneath it, already congealed. As far as Wonsik was concerned, it was a fairly cut and dry case\u2014or maybe he just hoped it was. Jaehwan certainly thought so, having wandered over even after Wonsik and Taekwoon had arrived, fully dressed and impeccably clean. Wonsik looked like he'd been hauled out of bed at three hours after midnight, and Taekwoon much the same. It was, of course, exactly what had happened.</p>\n    <p>It was only the three of them at the scene, and the four guards holding the lamps.</p>\n    <p>\"Four hours ago,\" Taekwoon said quietly. He sat up, tipped his head back to look at Jaehwan and Wonsik. \"From the smell on his clothes, he was drunk. He was\u2014\" Taekwoon rolled the body over onto its side, and Jaehwan wrinkled his nose at the blood stained mess, \"stabbed twice in the back.\" He mimed two knife thrusts, clean and precise. Let the body fall back down.</p>\n    <p>The eyes were blank, and there were no real identifying features. A middle aged man of middling height and middling size. He wasn't particularly ugly, nor was he particularly handsome. He didn't seem to be particularly rich, nor was he obviously poor. Probably a drunken fight gone wrong, Jaehwan had said. But a murder was a murder, and Taekwoon had latched onto this one like a dog with a bone.</p>\n    <p>\"There are three knife wounds in the chest. I'd say they're what killed him. But\u2014\" and here, Wonsik could feel Jaehwan perk up beside him, sleepy dullness suddenly discarded. Wonsik, on the other hand, was struggling to keep his eyes open. While he agreed, on principle that the fresher the scene was the better, he preferred those times to happen while he was awake, and before he'd gone to sleep, which often included much of the day. He hadn't been so fortunate this time.</p>\n    <p>\"But?\" Wonsik prompted, because he knew Jaehwan would rather crawl through horse shit than admit interest in anything Taekwoon said. Not that Taekwoon was any better.</p>\n    <p>\"But these are much older,\" Taekwoon said, turning the man on his side again. \"Maybe by two hours.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Two hours,\" Wonsik mused.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon nodded, letting the dead man back down again. He glanced back at Wonsik again, eyes passing over Jaehwan, and Wonsik came to crouch down next to him. After a moment, Jaehwan did as well, both of them watching as Taekwoon lifted up the dead man's arm, pulling back his sleeve, revealing the obvious marks of where rope had bruised his skin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ah, so not quite a drunk fight,\" Wonsik said. He didn't know whether to be interested or disappointed. </p>\n    <p>\"I want to take a look around,\" Taekwoon said, standing abruptly. It was, Wonsik had decided, quite unfair how awake Taekwoon was. Jaehwan had said so as well, that Taekwoon ought to have been the grumpy one. Taekwoon was not an early riser.</p>\n    <p>\"He's been looking forward to a murder for weeks,\" Wonsik pointed out.</p>\n    <p>\"Psycho,\" Jaehwan said under his breath, but more than loud enough for Taekwoon to both hear, and pointedly ignore. Wonsik sighed, shaking his head. He'd never understand those two.</p>\n    <p>There were several long seconds of silence\u2014a tribute to the early hour that seemed to have slowed Jaehwan's mouth considerably. Taekwoon was peering closely at the far wall, and Wonsik briefly debated moving closer to look as well. Taekwoon had taken over though, and he and Jaehwan had reached a silent and mutual agreement to let him. Murders were the most interesting, Wonsik agreed, but it was too early to be excited about a murder.</p>\n    <p>\"You can finally go catch your thief,\" Jaehwan suddenly said. </p>\n    <p>\"Oh?\" Wonsik raised his eyebrows, taking the folded sheet of paper that Jaehwan proudly shoved into his hands. It'd been copied out in Jaehwan's own hand, slightly messier and ink smudged, not helped by the circles and lines that obscured half of each character. Wonsik quickly skimmed across each row, combining the parts of the words that Jaehwan had indicated.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Another</i> vase?\" Wonsik groaned. \"How many does he need?\"</p>\n    <p>\"But not just <i>any</i> vase,\" Jaehwan said. He was, what Taekwoon called, <i>obnoxiously smug</i>, kind of like a puppy that was incredibly proud of having retrieved a rabbit that no one had quite asked for. In this case, Wonsik <i>had</i> asked for it, so Jaehwan had every right to be obnoxiously smug. \"Do you know the story behind the Red Iris Vase?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'm afraid not,\" Wonsik said. Jaehwan grinned, happy to be the bearer of a tale.</p>\n    <p>\"It's said to have been a gift from the Emperor's grandfather to the most beautiful lady in the kingdom, but they were cruelly torn apart because she was of base birth. It was passed on to her daughter who was just as beautiful, and then lost to time until it was delivered to the temple, as beautiful and fine as ever,\" Jaehwan said. </p>\n    <p>\"And why that temple in particular?\" Wonsik asked, frowning.</p>\n    <p>Jaehewan shook his head, a half shrug. \"No one knows,\" he said. \"There's rumours that she bore another daughter to the Emperor and she was hidden at the temple, but whatever it is, it's a very precious and unique vase.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Which would make it difficult to sell,\" Wonsik mused. \"Why does he steal things that he can't sell?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Or she,\" Jaehwan pointed out, and Wonsik regretted having ever broached that possibility to Jaehwan. \"Maybe they're really damn rich, they're just doing it for fun.\"</p>\n    <p>\"For fun?\" Wonsik's eyebrows went up again.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan shrugged. \"They could be a government official, with the way they write,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, I suppose so,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Cultured, smart, scholarly. Mysterious, you've never even seen his shadow. Leaves you gifts like cross-stitchings and children's toys... Writes poetry and clever riddles that not even Kim Wonsik can solve, although of course they weren't a problem for Lee Jaehwan.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik really couldn't help it, he had to pet Jaehwan on the head. No one was watching anyway; Taekwoon had gone back to poking at the body. Jaehwan screwed up his face and smacked Wonsik away.</p>\n    <p>\"Good job,\" Wonsik said. </p>\n    <p>\"So you're finally gonna catch him?\" Jaehwan asked. \"Can I come with you when you tell the nuns? I've always wanted to see that vase.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, we're not going to tell them,\" Wonsik said. Jaehwan's expression immediately morphed into disbelief and Wonsik lifted a shoulder in a small shrug. \"Taekwoon thinks we should smoke them out, wait outside. Otherwise we might tip him off and he won't show up.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Clearly he <i>wants</i> you to show up,\" Jaehwan said, frowning. \"He told you where he'll be. Although he could be lying.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, I don't think so,\" Wonsik said. He sighed. \"Maybe you're right, he's just doing this for fun. It's a game to him. But if they move the vase or hide it, then we've lost our chance.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Maybe that's what he <i>wants</i> you to do,\" Jaehwan said. Another frown. \"Since when did that grump make the calls?\"</p>\n    <p>\"He's become quite good at this,\" Wonsik said, trying to placate Jaehwan before he worked himself into another tirade over Taekwoon. He liked working with the prince, and he liked working with Taekwoon, but working with them both was like trying to mind a cat and a dog constantly yapping and hissing at each other at times. \"And it makes sense.\"</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan harrumphed, crossing his arms. Wonsik was about to placate Jaehwan but Taekwoon was walking over to them, simultaneously frowning and with a quirk of a smile.</p>\n    <p>\"He has a sister? We'll go talk to her,\" Taekwoon said with the air of someone having grasped the last thread of a complicated tale, and that, Wonsik supposed, was that.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>The night was dark as ink, not even a hint of stars sprinkled across the sky, painted over by thick clouds. It did not smell like rain, but there was no doubt that it would soon rain. One did not have to have studied the motions of the skies and the winds to read it in the clouds. Lights yet burned in the temple, although most of the nuns would have long been asleep. There were guards, of course, assigned by the Emperor, whose jurisdiction this temple fell under. It had been commissioned by one, nearly two hundred years ago, a different dynasty, a different family. Wrested away with blood as such things always were. Half an hour's ride by horse, close enough to be close yet far enough to be seen as a place apart. The sun would rise above the temple before it rose above the city, and that had held some significance when it had been built, on top of a small hill, if it could barely be called a hill.</p>\n    <p>There was no wind tonight, and certainly no rain. The night could not be said to be hot, but nor could it be said to have cooled significantly from the stifling heat of the day. Wonsik thought briefly back to the dead man two nights ago. It was good that they had been roused when they had been he grudgingly agreed\u2014bodies spoiled quickly in the summer, even early in the summer as it was.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon was almost preternaturally still beside him. There it was, another difference between Taekwoon and Jaehwan\u2014Jaehwan couldn't seem to stop moving, like a puppy with far too much energy. Taekwoon, on the other hand, seemed to be barely breathing, only his eyes flickering, catching shapes and shadows in the night.</p>\n    <p>Whereas Wonsik had all but resigned himself to never catching his thief whatever he'd told Jaehwan, Taekwoon pursued it with dogged determination, like he pursued so many things in life. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik didn't mind working through the cases that Jaehwan passed along to him, whether they were overly difficult or because he was overburdened, boring or not. Then there were those that people brought to him, knowing that the Young Master of the Kim family had a keen mind for such things. Taekwoon had been one of those people, several years ago, long before people started showing up on his metaphorical doorstep. They had never solved that one. Wonsik still counted it as his biggest failure. Second biggest failure. They had been children, it was true, and yet.</p>\n    <p>Since that day, Wonsik had found a friend, and an assistant\u2014a partner.</p>\n    <p>They had found the clock a few weeks ago, a chance finding. Taekwoon had found it in a store several cities over, one that dealt in such things. It was an old time piece, carved with the relief of a boar. One of the valuable things that had been stolen. They had chased that lead after the clock had been returned to the rightful owner, but it had ended at the home of a pig farmer whose ancestor had been the original maker of the clock.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon's frustration could be a frightening thing.</p>\n    <p>Despite the number of thefts\u2014or because of them\u2014there seemed to be no rhyme nor reason to them, the targets so varied that it was almost impossible to categorise. Wonsik had a keen mind, a puzzle solving mind, a sharp eye, and with the three of them, cases that ought to have been unsolvable had been cracked open, yet a simple serial thief had eluded them for over half a year.</p>\n    <p>And here they were, hidden outside a temple, drawn there by the thief themself\u2014daring them, taunting them. Wonsik couldn't decide whether he should feel belittled or flattered. </p>\n    <p>He thought about saying something to Taekwoon, asking what he thought of the situation, but it was too silent and still to break. Wonsik shuffled a little, disturbing the calm, but he was not Taekwoon and could not remain still as a rock.</p>\n    <p>The way the temple was built, there were few places where someone could enter or exit. The main way was guarded as well, and it didn't seem to be their thief's style to barge through the entrance, knocking the guards unconscious. They seemed to prefer to be a shadow, unfindable, unseeable, invisible. It was driving Wonsik nuts.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik tapped Taekwoon on the shoulder, gestured to the side with his head. Taekwoon nodded, a blur of a shadow, his eyes following Wonsik as he circled past Taekwoon to draw closer to the temple walls. He stood, back flat against a tree. Lanterns were hung along the walls, lighting it bright. Wonsik briefly wondered whose job it was to light them each night. He was still wondering this when he caught sight of a black shadow flip lithely over the wall.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon!\" Wonsik yelled over his shoulder.</p>\n    <p>\"Go around!\" Taekwoon was already streaking past Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik cursed, taking off in the other direction. He could barely see Taekwoon as he sprinted towards their thief, a blur of a shadow. Their thief paused, glanced towards Taekwoon. They were wearing a mask, but Wonsik could swear that they were laughing in the brief moment their eyes met.</p>\n    <p>And then Taekwoon was on them. Wonsik ran towards the two of them, almost overwhelmed by a sense of awe as he watched them exchange blows, their profiles dark against the light of the temple, clear above the wall. No, not even exchange\u2014Taekwoon kept catching empty air, the thief not doing much better, each one missing by a hair's breadth.</p>\n    <p>And then they were gone.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik wasn't quite sure how it happened: one moment there were two of them, and then Taekwoon seemed to disappear, and then the thief had disappeared into the night as if he'd never even been there.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon?\" Wonsik pulled to a stop, in front of Taekwoon collapsed on the ground. \"Are you hurt?\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon sat up, motions slow, his eyes slightly unfocussed. He shook his head, his expression pulled into a snarl, teeth grit and bared. \"He got away,\" he growled. He stared at the hand Wonsik offered him as if he was going to knock it away, before he took it and let Wonsik pull him to his feet.</p>\n    <p>\"Well at least that's one question answered,\" Wonsik muttered. He shrugged at Taekwoon's frown. \"Man or woman.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Too tall for a woman,\" Taekwoon said. A deeper frown. \"I think. They wore a mask and a hood.\"</p>\n    <p>\"They got away,\" Wonsik echoed Taekwoon. \"With the vase?\" Taekwoon nodded. \"<i>While</i> they were fighting?\" Another nod, Taekwoon's expression growing stormier. Wonsik rubbed at his temples, shaking his head in slight disbelief.</p>\n    <p>\"No wonder they were bold enough to tell us about this,\" Wonsik said. He sighed, nodding towards the road, hidden from their view.</p>\n    <p>\"Show off,\" Taekwoon muttered. He started walking, and Wonsik eyed his slight limp that Taekwoon was doing a very good job of hiding. It must have been a bad fall that Taekwoon had taken, if he hadn't immediately chased after their thief.</p>\n    <p>\"He's saying he's good enough that we can't get him even if we know where and what he'll be stealing,\" Wonsik said with a sigh. \"Have to admit he's got guts.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Show off,\" Taekwoon repeated.</p>\n    <p>He was, Wonsik knew, completely right.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>Wonsik slipped inside, closing the door quietly behind him. He'd been directed to this small hall when he'd asked after the Eleventh Prince's whereabouts, the sweet strains of a stringed instrument clear even from outside, slipping out through the open windows and into the sun-lit afternoon. The graceful figure on the stage at front was brilliant in his rich red dress, the sun pouring in and casting him in radiance. Despite his care of silence, Jaehwan turned back at Wonsik's entrance and beckoned him forward. Wonsik acknowledged him with a slight bow, before making his way to sit by Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan said nothing, merely turned back towards the dancer. Wonsik would not have wanted him to do anything else\u2014it was hard to look away from him, from the elegant lines of his body, the shimmer of light against the thin sword in his hand, the way the fabric fluttered behind him as he seemed to almost float across the stage. Wonsik thought he recognised the young man who was playing accompaniment, but it was the briefest flicker of thought before his attention was drawn back towards the dancer.</p>\n    <p>It was hard to look away from him. </p>\n    <p>His body was lithe, and watching him dance was like watching the water in a stream, the breeze on a spring day. Long, fine hair followed his movements, decorated with jeweled ornaments. His skin was too dark to be truly beautiful, yet his eyes shone, sharp and entrancing, and in the brief moment their eyes met, Wonsik's heart thudded a little louder, and a smile seemed to flicker across the dancer's lips.</p>\n    <p>His sword seemed to be an extension of him, so fluid his motions were. His fingers skimmed along the blade's edge, his sleeve following in their wake. </p>\n    <p>There could be no way to describe his dance but mesmerising, enchanting, enthralling. It was too soon that it ended, too soon that the dancer drew his hands together, bowing towards Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>\"Beautiful,\" Jaehwan declared, clapping. \"Absolutely beautiful.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik clapped as well, enthusiastically. \"Beautiful,\" he agreed.</p>\n    <p>\"My Lord is too kind,\" the dancer said, and Wonsik's heart caught in his throat at those few words; his voice was as lovely as the rest of him.</p>\n    <p>\"What's your name?\" Wonsik suddenly said. He could feel Jaehwan's eyes turn sharply on him.</p>\n    <p>\"Your humble servant is named Hakyeon,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"Hakyeon,\" Wonsik repeated, nodding. \"You're new here?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, and he deserves it doesn't he,\" Jaehwan cut in, grinning brightly at Wonsik. Wonsik nodded in agreement, even as Jaehwan turned away from the dancer to face Wonsik. \"So what did you come for?\"</p>\n    <p>\"With the Prince's permission, your servant will take their leave,\" the dancer, Hakyeon, said, bowing again. Jaehwan nodded, a brief dismissal.</p>\n    <p>\"I'd like to see you again,\" Wonsik said, and Hakyeon bowed.</p>\n    <p>\"Young Master is too kind, but if it would please you, your servant looks forward to dancing for the Young Master again,\" Hakyeon said, before retreating. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik watched him go, the fabric draping off of his narrow shoulders, his sleeves gathered, his sword sheathed. With a gesture from Jaehwan, everyone else left the hall as well, leaving only the two of them seated at the low table. Wonsik poured them both tea, first for Jaehwan and then for himself.</p>\n    <p>\"He's not from the city?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, but he dances beautifully,\" Jaehwan said with a wistful sigh. \"His voice is pleasant as well. I've decided I will keep him after all.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I agree,\" Wonsik said, and Jaehwan's eyebrow quirked a little as he glanced towards Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>\"Someone's taken with him,\" Jaehwan said, a little too gleeful for Wonsik's taste.</p>\n    <p>\"He dances well!\" Wonsik protested, but he couldn't hide from Jaehwan's pointed looks. He sighed, and then drew out small lacquered box and handed it to Jaehwan. He gestured for Jaehwan to open it.</p>\n    <p>\"I found this outside my door this morning,\" Wonsik said. A pause. \"My room door. Not the main gate.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Wow, a gift from your thief?\" Jaehwan asked. He undid the clasp and opened the lid to reveal a delicate glass flower. Jaehwan whistled. </p>\n    <p>\"And this,\" Wonsik said. He handed Jaehwan the folded sheet of paper that had been pinned under the box's weight.</p>\n    <p>It'd been two nights ago since their spectacular failure in catching their thief, and Wonsik had been almost surprised when there had been no note left behind at the scene when they'd been called there the morning after. Taekwoon had been a stormy presence, the nuns giving them a wide, wide berth because of it. Wonsik couldn't even be bothered to tell him to turn it down. </p>\n    <p>He'd been much less surprised to find the gift, as Jaehwan had put it, this morning. Almost resigned. He hadn't told Taekwoon yet\u2014he didn't want Taekwoon's foul mood to grow too foul when he was in the middle of treating a patient. It could wait until tonight.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Good job solving the puzzle! Better luck next time! Your friend's very good, I was a little worried, but it all turned out okay. I almost thought you hadn't figured it out, it's a good thing I didn't let my guard down. I had to get a friend to make this for me, I'm still learning and I'm not very good yet. It's pretty, isn't it? Take good care of it, don't let it get stolen!</i>\" Jaehwan read out, his voice almost sing-song. Wonsik wanted to groan.</p>\n    <p>\"He writes like a five year old,\" Jaehwan noted.</p>\n    <p>\"The letters are getting longer,\" Wonsik said. </p>\n    <p>\"You know, I was kinda joking about him courting you, but I think he really <i>is</i> courting you,\" Jaehwan said, looking between the glass flower and the letter, eyes a little wide.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh, and Taekwoon said they're a he, so that's one puzzle settled,\" Wonsik said, steering the conversation onto safer ground.</p>\n    <p>\"You saw him?\" Jaehwan perked up with interest.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik nodded. \"He's tall, a skilled fighter\u2014he bested Taekwoon.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Ooh, I bet he's not happy about <i>that</i>,\" Jaehwan said, grinning a little too widely. Wonsik decided not to say anything to that.</p>\n    <p>\"Anyway, I just wanted to let you know,\" Wonsik said. He sighed. \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I've given up on ever catching him.\"</p>\n    <p>\"An uncatchable thief,\" Jaehwan mused. \"Are you sure it's not because he's courting you?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Of course not,\" Wonsik snapped.</p>\n    <p>\"I guess you don't have that many clues to go on, huh,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"Other than that clock that went nowhere,\" Wonsik said glumly. \"And that he's tall, scholarly, cultured, and all around skilled.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's not like you have much else to do,\" Jaehwan said with a small shrug. He refilled their tea, brushing off Wonsik's attempts to correct his negligence. Jaehwan had never been the most particular about court manners.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon tied up the murder too quickly,\" Wonsik agreed. Irritation flickered across Jaehwan's face\u2014Wonsik resisted the urge to point out Jaehwan hadn't done any work on it and hadn't particularly wanted to.</p>\n    <p>\"You should just take the imperial officer exams,\" Jaehwan said. He prodded at the glass flower. \"It's not like you have anything else to do.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I suppose,\" Wonsik said with a sigh. His father had not so subtly suggested it as well. \"I don't think I'll do very well.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Why not? You're smart, kind of,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"Thanks for the confidence,\" Wonsik said, smiling wryly. \"I've never been good at book learning.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I could always put in a word for you,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"That kinda makes the exam useless, doesn't it?\" Wonsik said. Jaehwan shrugged.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik scratched at his neck, staring down at the flower that Jaehwan was playing with. He reached across the table to take it back, Jaehwan easily relinquishing it.</p>\n    <p>\"I suppose I should be going,\" Wonsik said. He stood, bowing briefly towards Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>\"Wait,\" Jaehwan said, before Wonsik could even turn. He was grinning, and Wonsik arched a brow. \"Don't you want to know where Hakyeon's staying?</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\"Well, this is a surprise.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik's mouth opened, and then closed, and then he very visibly swallowed. Bright eyes greeted him, laughing, and there was very little surprise in them. Unlike Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>\"Come in,\" Hakyeon said. He stepped back into the room and Wonsik put his hand down\u2014there was little point of knocking when the door had opened before you'd had a chance. Wonsik followed the dancer into the small guest house, closing the door behind him.</p>\n    <p>The room was bright and well lit, and Wonsik took a moment to orient himself as Hakyeon gestured for him to sit. It was much smaller and simpler than the rooms Wonsik was used to staying in when he was at the palace, which made a great deal of sense. There was only the low table and the bed, with no elaborate decorations to fill the room. Wonsik sat, followed Hakyeon with his eyes as the other man fetched a small bottle of wine and two cups.</p>\n    <p>\"Master Kim Wonsik, right?\" Hakyeon asked. His smile could almost be called mischievous. His face was bare, makeup wiped clean, his hair unpinned and barely bound; it was almost uncomfortably intimate after their initial meeting, although Wonsik couldn't have said why. His manner was easy, relaxed, some outermost layer of propriety shed leaving him with an odd sense of vulnerability that Wonsik couldn't quite put his finger on. Even as the thought flit through his mind, it seemed to have already vanished like smoke, dispelled by unhurried movements, confident and nonchalant.</p>\n    <p>\"Y-yeah?\"</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon laughed, his eyes crinkling. \"I may have run into Prince Jaehwan after we met,\" Hakyeon said. He poured for them both, sleeve gathered delicately beneath his arm. It was with perfect form, illustrated grace. He had, Wonsik noted with a detached mind, very pretty fingers and very pretty hands.</p>\n    <p>\"I was hoping you'd come,\" Hakyeon added. Wonsik nearly choked, his hand stuttering as he reached towards the cup.</p>\n    <p>\"I, uh, your dancing was very impressive,\" Wonsik said. He laughed awkwardly, rubbing at his neck. \"Sorry, I'm not usually like this, you just caught me a little off guard.\"</p>\n    <p> \"Ah, did I? I suppose I'll have to apologise,\" Hakyeon said. He picked up his cup, and held it up towards Wonsik in a toast. Wonsik acknowledged it, returning the gesture. He couldn't help but glance out of the side of his vision as he drank, watching the way Hakyeon carefully hid behind his other hand, turned slightly away, graceful and elegant in this as everything he seemed to do.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan had led him past this room earlier today after they'd left the hall, wandering the grounds in no discernible pattern as they chatted of more mundane things\u2014or rather, as Jaehwan caught him up on all the latest palace gossip. It had been too casual to be casual, the way Jaehwan had gestured at the door which Wonsik had most recently passed through: 'the dancer just now's staying there while he's here,' Jaehwan had said, his tone leaving very little need to guess at what Jaehwan was hinting, his smirk eliminating all doubt. Wonsik had flushed bright red.</p>\n    <p>\"I only happened to pass by,\" Wonsik said, after they'd both set their cups down on the table. A delicate arch of the eyebrow. \"Took a walk to clear my head and I thought I would give my greetings since I happened to walk by your door.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Oh? You live in the palace as well?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik shook his head. \"The Emperor gave me permission to come and go freely, at least to Jaehwan's residence,\" he said with another awkward laugh.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't realise you were such an important person,\" Hakyeon said. He had a delightful laugh. \"I saw someone standing outside the door for quite some time and thought I might as well welcome them in. You <i>were</i> thinking of coming in, weren't you?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik nodded.</p>\n    <p>\"This is quite a ways for a walk,\" Hakyeon said, before Wonsik had a chance to gather his thoughts. \"You must really have wanted to see me.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Ah, no, I was really just...taking a walk to clear my head,\" Wonsik said again. Which was, in many ways, the truth. It was something else that had led him here to the palace, a destination that had been planted in his mind as a seed much earlier in the day, sprouting when he hadn't had any when he'd stepped outside the door. He had briefly considered calling on Taekwoon, but Taekwoon had seemed pre-occupied when Wonsik had passed by. He'd tell Taekwoon about the gift tomorrow.</p>\n    <p>\"So you weren't coming to see me?\" Hakyeon asked, light and teasing. Wonsik began to slowly shake his head, when Hakyeon's expression immediately turned into a sense of resigned disappointment.</p>\n    <p>\"I was hoping you were,\" Hakyeon said. He laughed softly, to himself, at himself. \"Forgive me, Young Master, your humble servant has been rather presumptuous.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You were?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Please forget I said that,\" Hakyeon said. His eyes were downcast, turned away from Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik bit briefly at the inside of his lip. \"I was hoping to find you,\" Wonsik admitted, words measured, gauging Hakyeon's reaction. It was like the dawning of the sun, the way a tentative smile returned to Hakyeon's expression, the uplift of his eyes, and then something that Wonsik couldn't quite name as Hakyeon shifted sideways, his robes whispering with the movement.</p>\n    <p>He was no longer wearing the delicate silk robes that he had danced in, trading the bright red for something paler, softer, an unobtrusive blue of plain spun cloth. Wonsik watched him as Hakyeon drew closer to Wonsik, moving to the side of the table. </p>\n    <p>\"So you did come to see me,\" Hakyeon said, and there was almost a purr in his voice that sent blood rushing straight down to the base of Wonsik's stomach. This close, the word <i>feline</i> swished through Wonsik's thoughts as he met Hakyeon's eyes; the shape, or the almost predatory look, or simply how lovely they were. Wonsik swallowed, Hakyeon now so close that he was all too easy to reach out and touch, looking at Wonsik with the hint of a smile.</p>\n    <p>\"I, uh, yeah?\" Wonsik stammered.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon was very close now, and he smiled in a self-satisfied manner. That brief moment of dejection was gone, as if it had never happened. Wonsik could only stay seated, frozen, as Hakyeon leaned closer towards him, was long off any sort of chair and was on the floor next to Wonsik. </p>\n    <p>\"Jaehwan already said he wanted to keep you,\" Wonsik blurted out.</p>\n    <p>Silence rung loud behind his words, Hakyeon arrested, stone-still, the rustle of his clothes vanished from the room. A faint flush had risen in Hakyeon's cheeks, and Wonsik bit at the inside of his cheek\u2014he had spoken horribly out of turn.</p>\n    <p>But the moment was gone in an instant, and the corners of Hakyeon's lips lifted in a smile. \"Do you really think I'd have so little self respect?\" Hakyeon murmured, staring steadily into Wonsik's eyes, and yet, there had been a flash of triumph so brief that Wonsik wondered if he had imagined it. \"Or is it that you don't realise how handsome you are?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik tried to say something, but all that came out was garbled silence, and he shut his mouth to preserve what little dignity he had left.</p>\n    <p>\"Just 'Jaehwan', hm? Although if you're so close with the Prince\u2026\" Hakyeon laughed at his own words and then sat up. He was still seated on the floor, his legs folded to the side, only half covered by his robes. There was a small hint of a shrug, the sense of a head tilted in consideration. </p>\n    <p>\"He also agrees you dance well,\" Wonsik said, words a little too mumbled. This only drew a delighted laugh, and fingers resting lightly on Wonsik's thigh, the touch sparking through him like electricity.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm only teasing,\" Hakyeon said. His smile was kinder now, softer, and Wonsik was briefly struck by how nuanced his expressions were, and also by the lines about his eyes, wan and weary. The fingers on Wonsik's thigh trailed slightly upwards, testing, a question that Wonsik wondered what the best answer would be.</p>\n    <p>Which was, Wonsik realised half a second later, very silly. If he couldn't put even this much together, what sort of lousy investigator would he be?</p>\n    <p>A very beautiful man was resting his fingers on Wonsik's leg and had given Wonsik every indication that he would be very, very receptive to Wonsik kissing him.</p>\n    <p>So he did.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik placed his hand behind Hakyeon's head, tugging at his arm until Hakyeon was half on his lap. His arm was thin but firm, some detached part of Wonsik's brain noted as he kissed Hakyeon, the dancer bringing his arms about Wonsik's neck, his waist, soft breaths brushing against Wonsik's lips. Wonsik sucked at Hakyeon's lips gently, experimentally\u2014was rewarded with a small laugh as Hakyeon pulled back just enough to meet his eyes, Hakyeon's own eyes crinkled in amusement.</p>\n    <p>\"There we go,\" Hakyeon murmured. He dipped closer to Wonsik, kissed him softly, gently, his lips soft and sweet. Hakyeon hummed; pleasure, acknowledgement, and Wonsik seemed to only spare half his mind to kissing Hakyeon back, too absorbed by the faint scent of flowers on Hakyeon's skin, the firm muscles in his back, shifting under Wonsik's hand, beneath the fabric with every minute motion.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik didn't know how long they stayed like that, Hakyeon drawing back every now and then, leaving Wonsik to lose himself in the light shining from Hakyeon's eyes. Did know when Hakyeon stood, tugging Wonsik to his feet as well.</p>\n    <p>\"Let me see you,\" Hakyeon said, his voice low in a manner that thrummed through Wonsik's veins, left him no doubt as to what Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>He followed Hakyeon to the bed, watched as Hakyeon drew off his outer jacket, and then undid the fasteners, letting his clothes slide off his shoulders, pool on the floor. Watched as Hakyeon slowly bared himself entirely, his skin dark and golden and glowing. Wonsik's mouth grew dry.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon sat down on the bed, his eyes on Wonsik, and it was the unabashed manner with which Hakyeon sat there that had Wonsik removing his own clothes\u2014far more slowly, shivering a little when he stood there, chest bare, Hakyeon's eyes devouring him with interest.</p>\n    <p>\"As I thought,\" Hakyeon said with a small quirk of a smile, \"you are lovely.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You are,\" Wonsik blurted out without thinking. Blood immediately rushed to his cheeks and Wonsik looked down, away. Hakyeon stood, was in front of him, hand on Wonsik's chest. Wonsik shivered at the touch, looked up sharply at Hakyeon, but Hakyeon wasn't looking at him, was looking down at Wonsik's body. Wonsik swallowed as Hakyeon ran his hand down Wonsik's chest, Wonsik shuddering.</p>\n    <p>\"I am not often struck speechless, but I may be right now,\" Hakyeon said, and his own voice was low and hoarse despite the teasing quality of his words. Wonsik stared at Hakyeon, then looked down when Hakyeon's fingers had fallen to the waist of Wonsik's pants. Wonsik sucked in a sharp gasp of air, but didn't stop Hakyeon as Hakyeon slowly undid the ties, nodded a little when Hakyeon glanced up, exhaled deeply as Hakyeon pushed his pants down past his hips, his thighs.</p>\n    <p>\"I have to say, I wasn't expecting such nice legs,\" Hakyeon said, and Wonsik could only blush.</p>\n    <p>\"Um. Thanks?\" he said, and he cursed himself for his coherence, or lack thereof. Hakyeon laughed, soft and clear, and then he was pulling Wonsik onto the bed.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm afraid I'm a bit less prepared than I would have liked,\" Hakyeon said, and Wonsik didn't have time to ask him what he meant before Wonsik was being pushed flat onto the bed. Hakyeon's hair tumbled over his shoulder, brushing against Wonsik's arm as Hakyeon bent over him.</p>\n    <p>\"Wonsik\u2014may I call you that? Young Master is a bit of a mouthful for times like this,\" Hakyeon said, and Hakyeon may have said he'd been struck speechless, but Wonsik felt like the world was spinning and pushing far faster than he could ever hope to keep up, never mind respond coherently. Wonsik nodded, and was rewarded with a bright smile.</p>\n    <p>\"I feel like a very lucky man right now, Wonsik,\" Hakyeon said, and Wonsik's name coming out of Hakyeon's mouth was doing all sorts of things to Wonsik's body.</p>\n    <p><i>I should be the one saying that</i>, flickered through Wonsik's mind but he couldn't seem to quite get the words out. Hard to, when there were hands roaming all across your body, when the man on top of you was slim and lithe and narrow waisted and well muscled all at once. There were fine white lines, incongruous, and Wonsik ran his finger down one along the side of Hakyeon's body.</p>\n    <p>\"What happened here?\" he asked, some semblance of coherent thought.</p>\n    <p>\"Follies of youth,\" Hakyeon answered, and the dry twist of his mouth was out of place and Wonsik almost regretted asking, but then Hakyeon was running his finger down the center of Wonsik's chest, along the ridges of bone, buried beneath skin.</p>\n    <p>\"And to think you thought I wanted you for anything else,\" Hakyeon murmured, and this was into the crook of Wonsik's neck and Wonsik sucked in a sharp breath of air. \"You're even lovelier than I thought, Wonsik.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I should be the one saying that,\" Wonsik managed to choke out this time. It was a wonder, with how Hakyeon's hand had trailed lower, was resting on the jut of Wonsik's hip. He was expecting and he also wasn't, Hakyeon's touch drifting towards the inside of Wonsik's thighs\u2014and then Wonsik cried out, loud and helpless.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik lost track of things, a little after that.</p>\n    <p>It seemed both ages and far too soon before he lay there, breathless, the dancer curled half on top of him. Sweat glistened off his skin, and Wonsik was struck by a sudden desire to lick down his neck. He hadn't noticed how long Hakyeon's neck was, not until this moment. With his hair pulled back, the mole just by his hairline and another a little further down were visible, and Wonsik wanted to kiss those too. Wonsik could feel Hakyeon's sweat against his own skin, Hakyeon warm, his touch damp and slick, and glowing even more, if it were possible.</p>\n    <p>It seemed a shame, and with great reluctance, that Wonsik made to sit up, pushing Hakyeon gently to the side. He felt strange, off-kilter, his body flushed and relaxed but his heart suddenly flipping in his chest in strange, unpredictable rhythms, his throat oddly dry. Wonsik swallowed, stared at Hakyeon who was lounging on the bed, propped up on an elbow as he gazed up at Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>\"Leaving so soon?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik blinked, trying to process what Hakyeon meant. He settled for nodding. He suddenly felt very naked and bare, and he flushed, even though Hakyeon was just as naked. Wonsik was not used to such scrutiny, and he hastened to dress.</p>\n    <p>\"I've taken a long walk,\" Wonsik said ruefully as he tugged on his pants. \"I should get back before my people wonder where I am.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Oh? I would have thought someone like you, they'd be used to you not returning until dawn,\" Hakyeon said. He smiled, pleasant, something more lurking too obviously under his voice, peeled back by his words.</p>\n    <p>\"I\u2026 don't do this. Much,\" Wonsik said. His ears were colouring, and Wonsik resisted the urge to rub at them, just quickly finished dressing.</p>\n    <p>\"Well if you're right about Prince Jaehwan, I suppose it's alright,\" Hakyeon said. He sat up, crossing his legs. Wonsik found his eyes drifting towards them, and then quickly looked away\u2014but not before Hakyeon caught him looking and smirked knowingly.</p>\n    <p>\"It's alright?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Mm, and I'll be better prepared, next time,\" Hakyeon said. He stretched and Wonsik froze, admiring the lines of Hakyeon's body, the colour of his skin. He caught himself staring, tugged at his jacket as if it needed fixing.</p>\n    <p>\"Next time,\" Wonsik repeated. \"Right. Uh, I'll be going\u2014good night,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"I look forward to dancing for you again,\" Hakyeon said\u2014Wonsik couldn't quite tell if there was supposed to be another meaning to that or not.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>The sun was too bright and hot, the streets too dirty and noisy, and Wonsik really hadn't had nearly enough sleep.</p>\n    <p>\"There's something bothering me,\" Taekwoon had said, showing up at Wonsik's door just barely after the sun had. His steward, unfortunately used to such things, had ushered Taekwoon in without a second thought, rousing Wonsik at the same time. At least he hadn't noticed the late\u2014or early, depending on how one counted\u2014hour at which Wonsik had returned. It had taken him quite some time to fall off to a fitful sleep after Wonsik had washed as best he could, and he'd been planning on sleeping well past dawn to make up for it all.</p>\n    <p>Being dragged by Taekwoon into the city had certainly not been in his plans.</p>\n    <p>\"This couldn't wait?\" Wonsik asked, still rubbing blearily at his eyes.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon had shoved a bun into his hands, and was eating his second one himself. Wonsik nibbled at it a morosely\u2014he'd much rather be asleep, in bed, possibly dreaming about what had happened the previous night while convincing himself it was not a dream. A flash of arousal swept through him at the thought, and Wonsik quickly turned his attention back to Taekwoon. Much safer.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon shook his head, and only quickened his steps.</p>\n    <p>\"What's bothering you?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>A shrug. \"Something,\" Taekwoon said. Extremely elucidating.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik pursed his lips and flipped through cases in his mind.</p>\n    <p>\"If I remember correctly, the Jang family: Master Jang is the Minister for public affairs, while the elder son is an official in the agriculture department. Five weeks ago, they reported the loss of a large amount of money, as well as some smaller items: the Lady's hair ornaments, a carved jade bracelet, and a belt sash,\" Wonsik recited. He tapped his fan against his hand as he thought, following Taekwoon's fast pace. They dodged a cart laden with produce, nearly running over Wonsik's foot.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon grunted an agreement.</p>\n    <p>\"I thought we agreed that the amount of money for such a high ranking family was a pittance, and that the other stolen items were easily replaceable?\" Wonsik frowned.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said. \"Something's still bothering me.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik sighed deeply.</p>\n    <p>\"You're not taking this seriously,\" Taekwoon said. His glance at Wonsik was loaded with accusation and Wonsik quickly looked away.</p>\n    <p>\"Well, it just didn't seem that important,\" Wonsik tried. \"Besides, if there's anything we've learned about this thief, it's that he's very careful.\"</p>\n    <p>\"He slipped up once,\" Taekwoon said. \"He might've slipped up before. Or again.\"</p>\n    <p>They arrived presently at the gate of the Jang manor. Taekwoon rapped at the door several times, and then nudged Wonsik forward.</p>\n    <p>\"Who is it?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Kim Wonsik,\" Wonsik said with an internal sigh, as the door opened and the steward of the Jang family stepped out.</p>\n    <p>\"Master Kim,\" the steward said, bowing. He lead them to an entrance hall. \"Please come in, your humble servant will go inform the Lady that you are here.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Take your time,\" Wonsik said, ignoring Taekwoon's intense stare at the back of his head. The steward briefly met Taekwoon's eyes when he looked up, and then hastily turned and disappeared into the compound. Taekwoon had a tendency to do that to people he didn't like.</p>\n    <p>\"He didn't do anything to you,\" Wonsik said to Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>\"He's incompetent,\" Taekwoon said offhandedly. \"Besides, it's amusing.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik shook his head in exasperation as he paced the room. Something was bothering Taekwoon. He tried to think back to when they'd first come, five weeks ago. No note, that time, but it was so oddly precise that it seemed like there was no one else who could have done it. None of the stolen objects had been near each other, had been in separate rooms, in fact, and it seemed unlikely there was more than one such thief haunting their city.</p>\n    <p>\"Do you remember who the bracelet belonged to?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik frowned as he turned at Taekwoon's abrupt question, hands behind his back. The youngest son, still a student, studying for his second round of examinations, about two years older than Wonsik. The bracelet had been his\u2014dark green jade of middling quality, engraved with flowers interspersed with graceful shaped orbs that tapered into slender tails, the symbol of protection and luck. It had clearly been made for a lady. He'd clearly been courting someone, there'd been several gifts for a lady in the room\u2014a hair ornament, newly bought, gold and jeweled and delicate. A necklace, unworn, of similarly elaborate decoration. He'd said as much, when questioned. And yet\u2014</p>\n    <p>\"The bracelet wasn't a gift,\" Wonsik muttered, and Taekwoon nodded, a grim smile, but a pleased look in his eyes. It wasn't the sort of thing the young man would give, it was too simple, plain\u2014but it had been well worn. No, it <i>had</i> belonged to a lady, yet the young man had implied it wasn't so. Taekwoon was right. There was a story here.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik was about to spin it further when the steward returned. He glanced at Taekwoon, and had to hide a grin.</p>\n    <p>They found themselves several hours\u2014and several snacks\u2014later, well outside the city. An odd expression was on Taekwoon's face, if you knew what to look for, beyond the passive blankness that few people bothered to look past.</p>\n    <p>\"I think you made the right decision,\" Wonsik said. They walked back to their horses, leading them slowly back to the main road. Taekwoon was still silent, although his eyes flickered back to the cluster of houses they were now leaving.</p>\n    <p>\"We learned something about our thief,\" Wonsik said, keeping an eye on Taekwoon. Taekwoon gave the barest shrug, if it could be called that. \"Maybe we'll find something if we go back and look at the other stolen items.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Like the clock?\" Taekwoon said, and there was still undoubtable bitterness there. Like this, it had been a lead they'd started following full of hope but had dead-ended in a manner not too dissimilar from this.</p>\n    <p>An item, returned to the rightful owner.</p>\n    <p>\"He's good,\" Wonsik admitted grudgingly with a little too much awe. \"If he weren't a thief, he'd make a good investigator. Unless...he is one?\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon shook his head.</p>\n    <p>\"You're probably right. Yet, to trace a bracelet stolen first from the young miss by her former friend, and then taken by the Jang son when she rejected his advances\u2026 My instincts say that the bracelet was the real target, and everything else was incidental,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon nodded, and Wonsik bit back a sigh. He still hadn't told Taekwoon about the note the thief had left the previous day\u2014maybe now would be a good time, when his mood was already low. It'd been a while since Taekwoon had said so little like this.</p>\n    <p>\"A gentleman thief,\" Wonsik mused. \"Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Or, returning to the poor in this case, while leaving a little something for everyone around them.\"</p>\n    <p>\"If he hadn't left them the money, they might have sold the bracelet, like the clock had been sold,\" Taekwoon said. Wonsik looked at him, but Taekwoon was still staring ahead. Wonsik's horse pulled a little at her halter, and Wonsik turned away from Taekwoon to soothe her. \"The Jang family didn't need the money. Or the bracelet.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I wonder what he did with the belt sash,\" Wonsik said thoughtfully.</p>\n    <p>\"Wear it?\" Taekwoon suggested.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed. \"I suppose,\" he said. \"From what Master Jang said, it was a very handsome, expensive, well made belt sash.\"</p>\n    <p>\"And when we find him, he can hang by it,\" Taekwoon said\u2014Wonsik nearly froze at how firm his words were, the harsh slant of his eyes.</p>\n    <p>\"I...I don't think that's necessary?\" Wonsik said. He sighed, shaking his head. He could tell\u2014anyone could\u2014Taekwoon was beyond annoyed or irritated, and had gone straight to cold anger, likely born of frustration and Taekwoon's own short temper. Wonsik didn't blame him, not particularly, but it was still jarring to hear those words come from Taekwoon's mouth. He couldn't remember the last time Taekwoon had been so viciously eager to bring someone to justice, was usually content to let justice play out its own due course. Then again, Taekwoon had always had violent tendencies.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon gave him a strange look, his brows drawn close. \"He'll be hanged,\" he said simply.</p>\n    <p>\"Yeah, but with that belt sash?\" Wonsik asked. Taekwoon was right, of course. That, or beheaded. Clearly Taekwoon had already decided which one he wanted.</p>\n    <p>A shrug. \"It might break,\" Taekwoon said, a small pause of contemplation, jut of his lip. And then: \"you don't want to catch him.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik bit his lip, turning back to his horse. He could feel Taekwoon's eyes boring into the back of his head. \"He doesn't seem that bad,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"Because he leaves you gifts?\" Taekwoon asked, voice dangerously quiet, softer even than usual.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik shook his head. \"Just, it doesn't seem to be hurting anyone, you know?\"</p>\n    <p>\"What about that vase?\" Taekwoon asked. \"That was dear to the temple.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yeah, well\u2026\"</p>\n    <p>\"And the time he stole the painting that was a <i>wedding gift</i> from her father?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik stroked the side of his horse's face. \"It's not murder,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"It's still a crime,\" Taekwoon said, and this time, Wonsik did sigh. He paused, just long enough to mount his horse. A moment later, he heard Taekwoon do the same.</p>\n    <p>\"You're right,\" Wonsik said, offering Taekwoon a weak smile. \"I guess I should let you know he left a note about that vase.\"</p>\n    <p>\"That shit stick,\" Taekwoon growled, and then kicked his horse into a gallop. The only two people Wonsik had ever heard Taekwoon call such names were Jaehwan, and the thief. But Taekwoon was right, Wonsik was reluctant to catch him.</p>\n    <p>Technically, Wonsik wasn't obligated to. This wasn't, after all, his job. He just liked solving puzzles, that was all.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>It was early afternoon when they neared the retreat, the mountains that were omnipresent in the distance growing close enough that the peaks could be easily seen. Ginkgo trees lined the road, casting much welcomed shade onto the riders. They could see the stately roofs, built along the gentle slope of the base of the mountains, rising among the trees. From this far, it was impossible to see the fine details, but Wonsik had heard about the famed roof charms here. It seemed that nature had truly come together to build the perfect place\u2014the white foam of a waterfall could be just seen, carving out a path along the rocky crags of the mountains, through the trees.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik kicked his horse forward a few steps to ride up along Jaehwan, the eleventh prince dressed today in robes of rich blue, resplendent in silk. He turned his head at Wonsik's approach, shooting him a wide grin. </p>\n    <p>\"Pretty, isn't it,\" Jaehwan said. It was Wonsik's first time here at arguably one of the greatest imperial villas, and it was as awe-striking as he had heard.</p>\n    <p>\"Thanks for inviting along Taekwoon, by the way,\" Wonsik said. A flicker of irritation passed across Jaehwan's face, although Wonsik suspected it was at least a little exaggerated.</p>\n    <p>\"He's useful if anyone gets killed,\" Jaehwan muttered. Wonsik raised an eyebrow. \"And everyone else is so <i>old</i>.\"</p>\n    <p>\"True,\" Wonsik said, glancing ahead at the rest of their party, consisting of several high ranking ministers\u2014in other words, old\u2014and other officials of the court\u2014also old. Other than the three of them, only the guards and servants could, by any stretch be not called old. The Crown Prince, while not old, was certainly not young, and had never been young enough in Jaehwan's lifetime to have been a playmate. When the tenth prince had taken abruptly ill, the emperor had asked Jaehwan to be a representative for the court, and it had seemed only natural to Jaehwan to ask Wonsik along. </p>\n    <p>\"I didn't think he would come,\" Jaehwan added.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh?\"</p>\n    <p>\"<i>You</i> don't have any responsibilities, but I thought <i>he</i> did,\" Jaehwan said. \"Who would've guessed he could come without notice too? Obviously you could, all you do is read enough to study for the imperial exams even if you'll never take them, but he didn't need to.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed at Jaehwan's disgruntled face.</p>\n    <p>\"He has a pretty free schedule,\" Wonsik said. He paused, giving Jaehwan a sly look which Jaehwan ignored to continue projecting exaggerated irritation. \"Which you know about.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Ugh,\" Jaehwan grumbled.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik chuckled, glancing over his shoulder where Taekwoon was riding, trailing far behind the rest of the group. He'd been quiet most of the ride, although he'd been drinking in the scenery with deep interest. Now, he was staring ahead, some vague direction, perhaps at nothing at all. He'd jumped at the chance to tag along, which hadn't been much of a surprise, even if the invitation had been extended by Jaehwan. Secretly, Wonsik thought that the two of them didn't hate each other as much as they acted, although he wished to the heavens that they <i>didn't</i> act like that and leave him to mediate like the only adult between the three of them, even if he was younger in age than them both.</p>\n    <p>It had been over two weeks since the last theft, two weeks since they'd last had any sort of case at all. It had been oddly silent, but Wonsik suspected the oppressive heat might have had something to do with it. Here, the heat seemed to be lessened by the mountain breeze.</p>\n    <p>It was also two weeks since Wonsik had met, and last seen Hakyeon.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan had, as he'd said, extended an offer to the dancer, rather than ordering him to stay, immediately. That had surprised Wonsik; Jaehwan allowing him a full month to decide had surprised Wonsik even more.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prince is too kind,\" Hakyeon had said, prostrating himself. \"The Prince has bestowed upon your humble servant Hakyeon far greater an honour than deserved.\"</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon had, of course, accepted and promised a return within the month, once he attended to some matters with his family. Once he joined Jaehwan's retinue, it would be difficult for him to leave the palace or travel so freely, so Wonsik understood. He had lent Hakyeon the use of a horse: \"<i>someone's</i> fond of him,\" Jaehwan had cackled afterwards. Wonsik suspected he'd turned quite a shade of red.</p>\n    <p>\"He can go and return more quickly,\" Wonsik had said, but that hadn't stopped Jaehwan from making rather insinuating remarks every time they'd met, since.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik hadn't, for obvious reasons, told Taekwoon. Taekwoon might have seemed the strong, silent type to others, but he was also one of the biggest gossips that Wonsik knew, behind closed doors and to people he knew. Which was a thankfully small number of people, but rumours fled, and before he knew it, he'd be getting a letter from his father asking Wonsik why he was courting a lowly dancer, and a strong suggestion of so-and-so's daughter being available or intelligent or accomplished or some other positive quality or other. No, this was best something kept to himself\u2014and Jaehwan, but that couldn't be helped. And his steward, if things went well upon Hakyeon's return, but his steward was a discrete man, and with his father having lived away from the capital for so long, his steward was more Wonsik's man than his father's. </p>\n    <p>\"Thanks for coming,\" Jaehwan suddenly said. His smile was a little lopsided, and wholly genuine. Wonsik couldn't help but smile back, reaching over to pat Jaehwan on the arm, their horses drawing perhaps a little too close together. </p>\n    <p>\"You know I'd do anything for you,\" Wonsik said, chuckling.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan screwed up his face cutely. \"Save that for your lover,\" he said. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik coughed and looked away. He gauged they were less than ten minutes away, and glanced back at Taekwoon again. His friend seemed a little fidgety, and Wonsik caught Jaehwan's attention, gesturing back towards Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll find you after we're all settled,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"Yeah, sure,\" Wonsik said, and turned his horse back towards Taekwoon, smiling a little at Taekwoon's barely visible relief.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>He found Taekwoon sitting in a pavilion, a book on his lap, tea set by the table. The book lay forgotten, Taekwoon's eyes fixed on the water, at the lily pads, the fish that flashed in colours beneath the clear surface. Sometimes, Wonsik forgot that Taekwoon lived in a house without even a small courtyard, but he was reminded of that now, and every time he found Taekwoon in such places. Even Wonsik, who was far more used to such sights, was taken in by the beauty of these gardens, of their magnificence, the sheer size. Poetry was written about such places: <i>the pines bent in sunset's wind</i>, <i>water's mirror disturbed by a single stone, ripples fading beneath the bridges</i>. He had been walking for quite some time, and had only found Taekwoon now, tucked far away, in one of the corners.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan had, as promised, found Wonsik earlier, and they had spent some time in Jaehwan's rooms before someone had come to fetch Jaehwan and Wonsik realised he hadn't seen Taekwoon since they had been lead to their guest rooms. It had taken some asking to find where Young Master Taekwoon was staying, and Wonsik had been somewhat surprised to find the room empty.</p>\n    <p>Yet, Taekwoon made an elegant sight, as if he belonged here, and nowhere else. His long fingers rested on the table, pale and slender, the callouses and scars on his hands hidden from view. His dress may have been plain with few embroideries, certainly nothing like Jaehwan's silk robes, yet he still appeared somehow stately, majestic. His earrings glinted in the late afternoon light, flashes of silver like the sun against the surface of the pond itself. At Wonsik's approach, Taekwoon turned, the hard set of his eyes quickly softening when he saw who it was.</p>\n    <p>\"You found me,\" Taekwoon said. The gentle quality of his voice, too, seemed to be part and parcel of the quiet peace of this garden.</p>\n    <p>\"Somehow,\" Wonsik said with a quiet chuckle. He accepted the tea that Taekwoon poured him, raising it in thanks.</p>\n    <p>\"It's good tea,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>For all Taekwoon's excitement in accepting the invitation, he'd been subdued almost since they'd ridden out that morning. It had been a while since they had been among so many strangers; Wonsik couldn't blame him.</p>\n    <p>\"It is,\" Wonsik agreed. He nodded at Taekwoon's book. \"What are you reading?\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon held it up, and Wonsik recognised it instantly. It was a treatise that had been written almost two hundred years ago on investigative techniques, on signs to look for, on what a body looked like when it'd be strangled, on how to tell if a window had been broken from the inside or out. Wonsik had read it himself, several times.</p>\n    <p>\"It's peaceful here,\" Taekwoon said with a small shrug.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh?\" Wonsik tilted his head, not quite understanding.</p>\n    <p>\"It's good for reading,\" Taekwoon added. Wonsik chuckled softly. He refilled Taekwoon's empty cup, and then his own.</p>\n    <p>It was peaceful, that was certain.</p>\n    <p>\"You're still thinking about the thief?\" Wonsik asked. From the way Taekwoon stiffened, he knew he was right, even if Taekwoon had quickly shaken his head in denial. Wonsik shrugged a little, settling himself more comfortably on the bench. The pines on the opposite shore swayed in the wind, the same wind that ruffled through Taekwoon's hair, dark strands falling across his eyes. When he brushed his hair away from his eyes, Wonsik could see the scars on Taekwoon's palm and the inside of his fingers, testament to a lifetime of strict martial training. Taekwoon couldn't be said to be anything but dedicated, something that would never cease to impress Wonsik and hold his complete admiration.</p>\n    <p>\"This is only conjecture,\" Wonsik said slowly, \"but I think we can divide his targets into three kinds.\"</p>\n    <p>\"The first,\" Wonsik said, holding up one finger, \"are those like the bracelet. Items that might've fallen into the wrong hands, or that would be better in another's hands. The second is money. It's possible he's keeping it for himself, but from the Jang case, he clearly distributed it away entirely\u2014providing for those who have difficulty providing for himself. And the third, are those he's paid for.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Paid for?\" Taekwoon prompted.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik nodded, looking down at his three fingers. This last had always been a thought, but it was only now that other pieces were falling into place did he think it truly was pinned down.</p>\n    <p>\"Again, this is only conjecture, but I'd say he's a thief for hire. Too many of the items would be difficult for him to sell off, but they're still things people want. I dunno, maybe because they saw it once, or heard of them, or something?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Whoever's paying him likes vases,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>\"That could be,\" Wonsik agreed. \"It could be something to look into. A different approach, might get us more leads. Maybe we've been going about this case the wrong way.\" He was still staring down at his hand, and slowly, he put up a fourth finger. \"A fourth: curiosities for himself.\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon merely stared at him at this, and Wonsik shrugged.</p>\n    <p>\"Like the phoenix,\" he said, a wry twist to his smile. Taekwoon snorted. \"I bet he knew it was a chicken, and just wanted to prove it. It seems like something he'd do.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You seem to know the thief well,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>\"It's all conjecture,\" Wonsik said with a small shrug. \"If he were doing it out of malice, he wouldn't be leaving all those notes, I don't think.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Or those gifts?\" Taekwoon asked pointedly.</p>\n    <p>\"Or those gifts,\" Wonsik said, swallowing first. He sighed, picking up his cup and raising it to Taekwoon, Taekwoon doing the same as they drank their tea. Taekwoon refilled their cups, and they sat in silence for some time, except for the call of birds, the water lapping against the stones, the occasional sound of cups or pot being replaced on the table.</p>\n    <p>\"You know, it's a pity,\" Wonsik murmured, breaking the quiet. He met Taekwoon's inquisitive gaze with a small shrug. \"There's things I'd like to ask him, but I'd only get to if we catch him. But if we catch him, he'll be executed. A pity.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Which part?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik blew out a long exhale. \"Both,\" he said quietly.</p>\n    <p>\"You don't want to see him brought to justice?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n    <p>\"When I started doing this, it was never really about that,\" Wonsik admitted. \"Doing the right thing, yes. But sometimes the law just doesn't seem right, does it.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's the law,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik thought back to being a child, of secretly listening in on cases that his father heard and passed judgement on, according to the law. The law that his father was obligated to uphold, and would uphold regardless. The law, Wonsik had quickly learned, wasn't always fair.</p>\n    <p>He offered Taekwoon a wry smile. \"You're right,\" he said. It could be difficult, arguing with Taekwoon, and Taekwoon's eyes were set in a manner that said he would not be giving any ground.</p>\n    <p>\"Well, it all depends on catching him,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon answered with silence, and the slight furrow of his brows. </p>\n    <p>\"What do you think of this place?\" Wonsik asked, steering the conversation away to lighter streams.</p>\n    <p>\"It's pretty,\" Taekwoon said, staring out over the pond. He could see a small cluster of ministers at one of the distant pavilions, their heads bent in discussion. A pair of ducks swam serenely by, ripples following in their wake. The sun fell behind them, the shadows drawing long in front of them, the shape of the pavilion cast onto the surface of the water. Stalks of bamboo ringed parts of the pond where there were no bridges or other man-made constructs, and Wonsik could just catch sight of a rock formation, almost unearthly natural. </p>\n    <p>\"There will be hunting tomorrow,\" Wonsik said. \"Will you join?\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon nodded, and Wonsik smiled. It would be good for him, and Taekwoon was talented at such things. Wonsik's skill with a bow were sadly lacking\u2014he'd be perfectly happy remaining here, rather than embarrass himself.</p>\n    <p>But such things were oft dictated by fortune as not, both those small and momentous: the farmer who might have been slain by a stray arrow had his son not taken sick that morning, the lady who'd bought an ornament only to lose it the next day, an unexpected bout of rain that would lead to two young people sheltering together, and it would be dictated by fortune whether it might lead to a clash between nations, or to a harmonious joining. There are some who might call it 'coincidence', yet there are no 'coincidences' in this world. And so it was with Taekwoon, that fortune decreed he would not be joining the outing the following day.</p>\n    <p>It happened that the moon was far from full that night, only a thin crescent of silver visible in the clear sky, reflected off the pond, floating between the lily leaves. There was a breeze, as there had been all day, and it was a pleasant enough evening. Though the moon was not round, it was no less enchanting, unobscured in the sky. Poetry might have been written about it, had either of the three of them been more inclined to such things, but in truth, they were merely three young men enjoying that which youth bestowed upon them, and good wine.</p>\n    <p>The son of an emperor, the son of a magistrate, and the son of a man who had never held any importance at all. </p>\n    <p>It was a quiet sort of night, the birds themselves asleep. A deep night, a dark night. Jaehwan too, had been silent for quite some time, brought upon by the mood of the evening. No, it was far beyond the time which could be called evening, although equally far from the time which could be called morning. It was, by every definition of the word, the middle of the night, and it was quiet.</p>\n    <p>They sat, the three of them, at the square table, with Wonsik between Jaehwan and Taekwoon, as was so often the case when it was the three of them. Though Jaehwan was quiet and his words sparse, Taekwoon had yet to utter a single sound since he had joined them, his own steps carrying all the weight of a wraith's. But they were used to it, Jaehwan and Wonsik, and never was Taekwoon's silence a burden, when Jaehwan was so good at countering it, Wonsik easily filling that which remained. Tonight, however, it was Taekwoon's silence that all three of them were accompanying, as Wonsik poured all three of them another round of clear wine.</p>\n    <p>\"I used to think this was something only old men did,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed. \"Would you say we're old?\"</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan shook his head, his lips pursing thoughtfully, as he raised his cup to sip at the wine. \"No,\" he said after several long seconds. \"We're not old.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Took you a bit long to answer,\" Wonsik said with a chuckle.</p>\n    <p>\"I was being thoughtful,\" Jaehwan whined. \"I had to take some time to be thoughtful.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik patted Jaehwan on the arm. \"You did well,\" he said. Jaehwan pouted, whining as he squirmed. Off to the side, Taekwoon rolled his eyes, gazing out into the deep night, barely lit by sparse lanterns, both those that were set along some of the walkways, and those that wavered, carried by guards who were on patrol.</p>\n    <p>\"We're not old.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik and Jaehwan both turned to Taekwoon with wide-eyed surprise. Jaehwan opened his mouth and just as quickly shut it. Perhaps he was waiting for Taekwoon to continue, but it soon became apparent it was all they would be getting out of him for now.</p>\n    <p>It had been some time since Taekwoon had last been in Jaehwan's presence in such silence. The prince and silence were like oil and water\u2014but if one shook the two enough, they might appear for brief moments to be one before the illusion was broken. He'd been listening with only half a mind to what little conversation his friend and the prince had uttered, the rest sunk into a stillness like the surface of the pond itself. He was fortunate\u2014beyond fortunate\u2014to be able to see such things as this, he who had grown up in the house of a minor merchant, his father's brother with sons of his own. Such thoughts did not linger, merely tinged his being with warmth, appreciation, the presence of the moon on the pond.</p>\n    <p>It did not seem so long ago: the first time they had met Jaehwan, the murders the two had worked together to solve that had led to Wonsik's immediate approval from the Emperor, no doubt helped by Jaehwan's own clear appreciation of the son of Magistrate Kim. </p>\n    <p>A fortune beyond any which Taekwoon might've dreamed when he'd sought out the boy who was said to have a knack for solving mysteries.</p>\n    <p>But these too were only the most fleeting of thoughts, drawn away by the breeze, too gentle to even disturb the surface of the water.</p>\n    <p>They were not old, for to be old would mean to be nearing the end of one's life, and there was yet too much to do for that, for all three of them.</p>\n    <p>Just as one spoke of the calm before the storm, those moments where the wind and world itself seemed to still before the heavens crashed through that stillness to rend it with cries and tears, so too was the stillness of the night scarred with cries of \"<i>Intruder! Thief!</i>\", lights rushing through the paths of the retreat, and even before Jaehwan and Wonsik were on their feet, Taekwoon had vaulted free of the table, disappeared into the space between buildings, ignoring the calls of his name.</p>\n    <p>It was <i>him</i>. Taekwoon knew it, knew it in his very bones.</p>\n    <p><i>Fate</i>, they called themselves\u2014it was because of fate that Taekwoon was here. </p>\n    <p>He could not see the curl of his lip\u2014anticipation, satisfaction; or the focus in his eyes\u2014determination; only knew the ground flying below his feet, carrying him to where the shouts of the guards were the loudest. Useless as they might be, they had eyes.</p>\n    <p>He would escape towards the mountains. Taekwoon was sure. He would wait until the search had conceded defeat, and then circle to one of the other small towns that had grown against the base of the slope. It was what Taekwoon would do. He didn't know how the thief had gotten in, there was no lack of security in a place like this. </p>\n    <p>Had the thief meant to be seen, like he had shown himself to Taekwoon and Wonsik two weeks ago? No\u2014he quickly dismissed that thought. It didn't fit. Then, he'd slipped up, been seen, and would be fleeing. Taekwoon took a moment to orient himself, his eyes long since adjusted to the darkness. The thief would evade the guards, he had no doubt. He would not fight them if it could be helped. There was a tree\u2014Taekwoon used it to vault onto a roof. The thief had proven to be just as capable.</p>\n    <p>Defeat still smarted under his skin, and Taekwoon took off running, ahead of the guards' shouts. Taekwoon did not know the place well; the guards did.</p>\n    <p>It was instinct now that guided Taekwoon, and instinct that plummetted him through the shadows, dim and flickering. More shouts, mistaking him for the intruder\u2014idiots\u2014but someone must've recognised him because they soon quieted.</p>\n    <p>In the confusion, Taekwoon nearly missed it; a shadow a little too still, pressed against a wall. A grim smile of satisfaction.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon lept down, landed lightly.</p>\n    <p>Too little surprise, too much amusement. Eyes barely visible, face masked, shaded by his hood.</p>\n    <p>\"Hello, handsome,\" the thief said, stepping away from the wall. \"Here to see if you'll do better this time?\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon's only response was to spring forward, grab for the thief's wrist, but the thief danced away as if it were no effort at all.</p>\n    <p>\"He's here!\" Taekwoon yelled over his shoulder, voice raised far beyond he ever did.</p>\n    <p>Irritation, a frown, the same damned amusement. \"Reinforcements? Now that's not very fair\u2014I better leave before they get here,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>He lept <i>at</i> the wall, springing directly off of it, stepping easily onto the roof. </p>\n    <p>A half second of frozen surprise as he watched the thief sprint away, a slight curse, and then Taekwoon chased behind him on the street below. He could hear the guards, their steps loud, still yelling\u2014herding. They were nearing the boundary. No gate here, but the thief had no need of it. Neither did Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon lept, fingers just catching the edge of the roof's tiles, just enough leverage to swing himself up. He'd gained some time, running on flat ground, then lost some, getting onto the roof.</p>\n    <p>He hadn't chosen this roof uselessly. The thief would have to go through Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>\"Got you,\" Taekwoon said. Their eyes locked, Taekwoon firmly blocking their path.</p>\n    <p>\"Are you sure about that?\"</p>\n    <p>It was like a dance, the way the thief moved, no effort as he evaded Taekwoon's blows, fluid, graceful. His breaths were coming a little harder, but so were Taekwoon's. The thief's eyes had lost all amusement, were hard, inflectionless, giving nothing away. Taekwoon jumped back to avoid a blow, and in the same movement, shrugged off his jacket, throwing it forward.</p>\n    <p>\"Ah\u2014!\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon allowed himself a small grim smile, the thief momentarily tangled in Taekwoon's jacket. A moment\u2014enough time for Taekwoon to surge forward.</p>\n    <p>He grabbed the thief's wrist, felt it tense and jerk in his grasp. Taekwoon grit his teeth, gripped until it must've been bruising. The thief had already fought mostly free of Taekwoon's jacket\u2014enough to catch Taekwoon's wrist, fast as a snake's bite, stopping Taekwoon from snatching at his mask.</p>\n    <p>\"Nice try,\" he growled.</p>\n    <p>\"No quip?\" Taekwoon asked. The thief's grip on his wrist was no less forgiving than Taekwoon's. His eyes were dark, angled, unreadable, nearly hidden behind a fringe of hair, and despite the rest of his face being masked, there was the easy sense of a grit, forced smile.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't reveal myself to strangers,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon huffed in scorn, swept at his feet\u2014was wrenched forward, barely regained balance. Places traded. Each still gripping at the other, neither giving ground. Eyes still locked\u2014the sound of nearing footsteps, voices, lights.</p>\n    <p>For the first time, there was a hint of\u2014anger, it was anger, fierce enough it burned into Taekwoon, not even fear. He barely managed to keep the thief's wrist from slipping from his grasp\u2014and Taekwoon's hand was empty, torn skin under Taekwoon's nails, the thief free.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon was released, the thief lept back.</p>\n    <p>A small laugh. \"Can't stay to chat,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>No, <i>no</i>, he refused to let him get away. Taekwoon threw himself forward, a guttural growl. His hand shot behind him without thinking, blade slicing through clothes and flesh even before Taekwoon registered the hilt in his hand. A sharp hiss of air, stumbling, a brief moment of satisfaction and then Taekwoon's short sword flashed forward again, at least catching his arm, and then\u2014</p>\n    <p>blinding pain, red, darkness in his eyes. His turn to stumble, blood hot beneath his hand pressed to his face, eyes forced close.</p>\n    <p>Gone. He was gone.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>It was like watching the past, approaching the pair from the distance, the way they'd danced on the rooftops, mere shadows. Wonsik's breath came hard, Jaehwan following close behind him, and he could pick out Taekwoon in his familiar robes, light glinting off his silver earring. Again, one moment there were two of them, and then the thief was a blur of darkness disappearing into the night as if he'd never been there, and then Taekwoon seemed to disappear, steel bright and flashing in the dim lights. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik's heart hammered in his chest. He hadn't thought he could run any faster.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Taekwoon!</i>\" He could just pick out Taekwoon's form, crumpled on the roof, still and unmoving. He heard Jaehwan yell for a doctor, knew that the guards that had continued to chase after their thief would return empty handed, that Taekwoon was on a <i>roof</i> and it would take time for the rest of them to get to him.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon!\" Wonsik yelled again. This time, slow movement. Relief washed over Wonsik, almost drowning in the breath he hadn't realised had been choking inside him. </p>\n    <p>Taekwoon sat up onto his knees, and in the flickering light of the torches carried by the guards, Wonsik could see the blood covering Taekwoon's face. Dripping off of his face. The sound of Taekwoon punching the roof resounded even in the confused shouts surrounding Wonsik as he stopped beneath the building Taekwoon was on, breaths coming hard.</p>\n    <p>\"Can you get down?\" Wonsik asked Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>A grunt of assent, and then Taekwoon was at the edge of the roof, jumped down. He landed hard, and Wonsik hurried to his friend.</p>\n    <p>\"The doctor's on his way,\" Jaehwan said as he jogged up. </p>\n    <p>\"I'm fine,\" Taekwoon said. He waved Jaehwan away, despite the clear slash across his face, the blood that flowed freely and unstaunched.</p>\n    <p>\"He <i>stabbed</i> you,\" Jaehwan said, incredulous.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik began to wipe at the blood on Taekwoon's face with a handkerchief, which Taekwoon grabbed and dragged across his face far more roughly than Wonsik had been, wincing when he caught at where he'd been cut.</p>\n    <p>\"I got him first,\" Taekwoon said\u2014it was Wonsik's turn to freeze, stare wide-eyed at Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>\"You stabbed him first,\" Wonsik echoed. Taekwoon nodded, immediately grimaced at the motion\u2014he swallowed the second burst of pain.</p>\n    <p>\"You're fucking insane,\" Jaehwan said\u2014heavens knew Wonsik loved Jaehwan like a brother but even he had his limits.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Jaehwan</i>,\" Wonsik snapped. Immediately, Jaehwan's words seemed to catch up to him, and his mouth shut with such alacrity it ought to have been audible. Wonsik swallowed, softened his tone. \"See where the doctor is,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Alright,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm fine,\" Taekwoon said again. He'd cleaned the blood from his face\u2014Wonsik could see now the cut that extended across his closed eye, down to his cheek. Blood was still flowing, new tracks down faded-red skin. Wonsik frowned, and Taekwoon likely would have frowned back if he could.</p>\n    <p>\"Hold still,\" Wonsik said. He leaned closer, pried open the lid of Taekwoon's eye as gently as he could, but even so, there was a sharp hiss of pain that wasn't quite swallowed. No blood, no damage\u2014even Wonsik could tell so much.</p>\n    <p>\"I told you it's fine,\" Taekwoon said. He might have said that, but he was already wavering, the one eye that Wonsik could see barely focussed. \"I dodged. He barely got me.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik bit at the inside of his lip to keep from saying anything more. The worry that had pounded inside of him had subsided, replaced with an unfamiliar simmering anger\u2014whether at the thief or because of Taekwoon, he couldn't quite pick out even if he'd wanted to, even if he'd thought to.</p>\n    <p>\"It was reckless,\" Wonsik settled with saying.</p>\n    <p>As if to answer Wonsik, Taekwoon stood\u2014tried to stand. He swayed, and was barely caught by a guard that rushed forward to steady him, faster than Wonsik could get to his feet.</p>\n    <p>\"Young Master! Please sit until the doctor arrives!\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon, being Taekwoon, stayed standing.</p>\n    <p>\"What did he steal?\" Taekwoon asked. It was barely a mumble, and Wonsik had to strain to hear him as well, even standing beside Taekwoon as he was, his hand on Taekwoon's arm.</p>\n    <p>\"Marquis Dae's official seal,\" one of the guards said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik frowned. \"His seal?\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's different,\" Taekwoon said\u2014this time, his voice pitched intentionally so only Wonsik could hear. Wonsik nodded, already spinning through reasons. A glance at Taekwoon made it clear that Taekwoon was ready to jump on the case at this very moment, despite the smudges of blood on his face and his hand, as he kept trying to wipe it away from his eyes. Wonsik's mouth tightened.</p>\n    <p>\"You're not going anywhere but your room,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon opened his mouth to protest, but almost amazingly, said nothing. If anything, it worried Wonsik more, because it meant that even Taekwoon was acknowledging he wasn't quite 'fine'.</p>\n    <p>\"I brought the doctor!\" Jaehwan shouted, his voice far preceding his presence.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik turned with a visible breath of relief. The doctor was a middling aged man, younger than Wonsik might have expected, his beard still more black than gray. He wore a severe expression on his face, and was slightly out of breath as he arrived, although he carried very little with him.</p>\n    <p>\"Please, Doctor,\" Wonsik said, gesturing to Taekwoon. </p>\n    <p>\"I'm fine,\" Taekwoon said, yet again.</p>\n    <p>\"Get him to a room,\" the doctor ordered.</p>\n    <p>\"Understood,\" two of the guards said, immediately moving forward to support him.</p>\n    <p>\"No, let me,\" Wonsik quickly said before Taekwoon could turn on them. To his surprise, Jaehwan moved about to Taekwoon's other side, grabbing his arm. Taekwoon was no less surprised, enough so that when the prince started walking, tugging Taekwoon along with him, Taekwoon went. </p>\n    <p>The guards led them to a guest room, a bare distance away, although when Wonsik and Jaehwan lowered Taekwoon into a chair, he nearly collapsed into it.</p>\n    <p>\"You're an idiot,\" Jaehwan said frankly. Taekwoon's glare was half-hearted, and half as effective with one eye still forced shut. This time, Wonsik didn't bother reprimanding the prince, because just a bit, he agreed.</p>\n    <p>They stepped back, giving the doctor room. Taekwoon's fist clenched as he allowed the doctor to inspect the wound, but there was no other outward sign of discomfort, never mind pain. Beside Wonsik, Jaehwan recoiled instead at the sight.</p>\n    <p>\"We leave him to you, Doctor,\" Wonsik said, glancing towards Jaehwan. </p>\n    <p>\"The Young Master's injury is not severe,\" the doctor answered. Vindication flashed in Taekwoon's eye. \"However, he requires rest, and medicines\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"I can do it,\" Taekwoon said, cutting him off.</p>\n    <p>\"Young Mas\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"An infusion of peony root, ginseng, goji berry, and angelica root twice daily,\" Taekwoon said coolly. \"Keep the wound clean, and watch for signs of infection. A poultice of yarrow and tumeric can be used. Most importantly, the bleeding must be stopped.\"</p>\n    <p>\"He practices medicine,\" Wonsik said, cutting Taekwoon off before he could offend the man whose hands they'd just put Taekwoon in.</p>\n    <p>\"I see,\" the doctor said, not at all ruffled. \"Well, I will first stop the bleeding, as the Young Master said.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We will leave you to it,\" Wonsik said, bowing. He prodded a strangely silent Jaehwan out of the room, but not before giving instructions to the guards to have Taekwoon guided back to his room if he was able, and then ensure that he remained inside.</p>\n    <p>The night air, after the commotion, was almost stifling in its calm.</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan and Wonsik paused outside the door. They could just hear the voices inside, but they were too muffled to make out individual words.</p>\n    <p>\"A knife,\" Jaehwan said, quietly. \"He could've died.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No,\" Wonsik said. He smiled, wry and mirthless. \"Taekwoon wouldn't let himself.\"</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan huffed, beginning the walk back to their own quarters. Wonsik touched Jaehwan's arm, halting him.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll go to Marquis Dae's room,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll come with you,\" Jaehwan said. Wonsik smiled, a genuine smile as small as it was.</p>\n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik fell into his own thoughts as they walked, quiet otherwise surrounding them. It had been a calm that had not seemed out of place in the slightest mere minutes ago, but after such a brief yet disruptive storm, it was obliterating in its absence of chaos.</p>\n    <p>If he were to carry on the assumption that while some thefts were in the thief's own interests, most were those he'd been paid for, this was more than likely the latter. There were only so many people who might want Marquis Dae's seal, who might find it of use. It could help them pinpoint the culprit\u2014the one who wasn't the thief. Wonsik realised with a horrible, hurtling drop of his heart that he'd stopped thinking of the thief as a 'culprit'. He'd told Taekwoon earlier, that he couldn't quite decide if he wanted to catch the thief or not. Even now, knowing that Jaehwan was right, that Taekwoon <i>could</i> have died, Wonsik couldn't bring himself to wholeheartedly wish for the thief's capture, although it certainly tipped the balance in one side over the other.</p>\n    <p>The question then, Wonsik mused, pulling his focus back to the case at hand, was how the thief had got in, and what had motivated the theft. They must have known of this excursion\u2014the security, as heavy as such a place was guarded, was no match to the security in the palace itself. A flash of colour caught his eye; Wonsik caught his fan in his palm. Jaehwan had seen it as well and hurried over to it.</p>\n    <p>\"He disguised himself as a guard,\" Jaehwan said, tugging the outfit out from the bushes. \"Marquis Dae wouldn't know his face if he'd seen him, he doesn't know the guards from the retreat, even if he'd know he wasn't a guard from the palace.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yes,\" Wonsik agreed. He sighed, rubbing at his arm. A clue, more than they usually had to go on.</p>\n    <p>The other question: had the thief known that Wonsik and Taekwoon would have been there? Jaehwan? They had only decided to come the day prior. And if so, what was the purpose? He scratched his head unconsciously.</p>\n    <p>\"It doesn't seem like your thief to attack Taekwoon,\" Jaehwan suddenly said.</p>\n    <p>\"Mm?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I mean, he leaves you <i>gifts</i>,\" Jaehwan said. \"He doesn't seem like the kinda person who'd attack someone.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Except Taekwoon attacked him first,\" Wonsik said with a sigh. \"I'd forgotten he carried a short sword on him.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't even know he did,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n    <p>\"You wouldn't,\" Wonsik said. They'd come to the Marquis' guest room and both fell silent. If they could find a single clue, it'd be more than they'd ever had to go on.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"ii\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"ii\"></a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>Beyond the seal, nothing had been taken from the Marquis' room. Nothing had been touched, or even disturbed. The Marquis himself had not even been aware that anything had been amiss, or that anyone had been within the room he had been asleep in. He'd been shaken\u2014anyone would be. The guards had received a dressing down that made Wonsik wince in sympathy, and step forward to interrupt the Marquis' tirade. Many that night had seen the thief's skills, the guards could not be blamed.</p>\n    <p>They had found the thief's knife, fallen on the side of the building on which he and Taekwoon had fought. It'd been missed in the commotion the previous night, but easily spotted by a guard on patrol during the day. Dried blood dulled the shine\u2014Taekwoon's blood. It was a simple knife with a plain wooden hilt and sharpened many times over, about half the size of Taekwoon's blade, although Taekwoon's blade was scarce longer than some knives itself. It was not new, and there were no identifying marks. Not like Taekwoon's short sword, a flower engraved on the pommel. It had fallen limp from Taekwoon's hand after he'd been slashed across the face, but quickly retrieved.</p>\n    <p>The knife was among Wonsik's things now. He had enough martial training to recognise that the knife, as simple as it was, was well balanced and well cared for. Versatile, easily thrown, easily wielded. He didn't like to think that it had been the one that might have killed Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>No one, of course, had seen or noticed the thief enter. No one knew what he looked like. It seemed that an extremely alert guard had heard a sound like a fallen rock\u2014his wavering torch light had revealed the shape of a figure instead.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik nearly missed it\u2014a patch of wall just outside the doors barely off coloured. It was paper, he realised when he touched it. Frowning, he peeled it carefully away. His heart pounded as he brushed off the powder like substance disguising it the colour of the wall. There was a distinct smell he couldn't identify, and it was fine and dry when he rubbed it between his fingers.</p>\n    <p>It might have been reluctance that had slowed his hand as he unfolded the small note. By the fading light, he had to hold it close to his face, but there was no mistaking the handwriting.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Hello, Wonsik. I'm sorry about your friend, he surprised me, but I shouldn't have done that. I've left some things for him, I don't know when youll be retruning, I dont want to laeve it here. Will u belive mewhen i say i didntkno you wuld b there? I dont thnk youll seenymre of me, it seems like i'm not as good as i thought i was, and i dont thnk imqute rdy to b caght.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>The message ended there, the words slowly becoming more smudged and illegible, despite the thief's best efforts, strokes missing or in the wrong places. Spots of red had been wiped away but still remained, soaked into the paper. The usual sign off was blurred, messy. At the very bottom, a location and map had been drawn, although like the rest of the note, it was smudged.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik crouched down, fingers brushing at the ground. It'd been two days since that night\u2014the blood that had dripped down but been wiped away was brown and dried. It was, Wonsik assumed, two days old. What did it say that the thief had paid a visit to Wonsik that very night? Had left things for Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>These were the thoughts that Wonsik carried with him as he sat in the pavilion by the pond, a small flagon of clear wine on the table in front of him. He traced his finger down the curved ceramic of the flagon, looping his fingers about its narrow neck. They had returned early from the excursion, him and Taekwoon. Wonsik had taken Taekwoon home with him as soon as he'd been able to travel, bandage drawn over his face, covering one eye. It had been a ride made in silence, and Wonsik couldn't find it in him to force Taekwoon to talk. The Crown Prince had visited Taekwoon the afternoon after the incident, and Taekwoon had no rank to speak off and couldn't deny his entry; he had suffered the visit with all the dignity one might expect of a man who'd just been slashed across the face. As brusque as Taekwoon could be at times, he'd learned well of what manners could be expected of him. It'd been one of the first things Taekwoon had asked Wonsik when they'd started working together as a team.</p>\n    <p>It'd been three days since they'd returned, and the same moon that he, Jaehwan, and Taekwoon had gazed upon that night was now half-full. A clear night, again, but these few days had all been clear and hot. Jaehwan would return with the rest of the party in another two days\u2014idly, Wonsik wondered how Jaehwan had amused himself without himself and Taekwoon present. An inconsequential thought.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon was healing well. Those first two days, he'd quietly allowed the doctor at the retreat to tend to him. Those first two days, he'd been simply quiet in every way. Even with Wonsik, Taekwoon spoke only when prodded, and his answers rarely were longer than a word or two. Wonsik knew Taekwoon well enough by now to know when Taekwoon simply wanted to be left alone, and when it would be better to leave him alone than to try to drag him out of his silence. He'd been faint with blood loss the day after, but was now well enough to express his frustration at his own condition by rearranging and cataloguing his herbs and medicines with an unwarranted ferocity that had had Wonsik showing himself out the door. He'd come from Taekwoon's not long ago however\u2014at the least, Taekwoon trusted Wonsik enough to help him change his bandages. Wonsik suspected that it was more of a favour to Wonsik than anything else, Taekwoon's way of apologising for, well, being himself. </p>\n    <p>He hadn't told Taekwoon about the thief's note. It had taken Wonsik some effort to decipher the location that the thief had indicated: beneath the floorboards of an old, abandoned temple, some ways out of the city. Bound neatly with a cloth were several rather expensive healing foods and medicines that Taekwoon never would have used on himself. The cloth was smudged with blood. This too was now hidden in Wonsik's closet. He would wait for Jaehwan's return, and hope that the prince would agree to go along with Wonsik's plan to tell Taekwoon that the gift was from Jaehwan instead. It would entail telling Jaehwan about the thief's note, but Wonsik doubted that Jaehwan would reveal that to Taekwoon. </p>\n    <p>And that\u2014that was what had brought Wonsik outside this night, like a quiet breeze might push a wooden toy boat across this very pond. </p>\n    <p>It was nothing like the one at the retreat, nor the one at the palace, small and surrounded on all sides by the walkways of the manor. Like always, Wonsik was alone. The household was asleep, well used to their young master's night wandering ways. It had been months since his father had returned to their family home. Few of the rooms were not empty; Wonsik could barely recall the days when this manor had bustled with life, when it had been more than only him and his father, and then when it had been he alone. Thinking of it still sent a pang of grief through his chest, although it had been dulled and grayed by the long years.</p>\n    <p>There were many ways in which one could die.</p>\n    <p>It was easy to piece together what had happened on that rooftop between Taekwoon and the thief, just before Wonsik had arrived. It had been faster than the eye could follow, as intricate as a dance, the twining of gales and streams\u2014a brief conjuration in Wonsik's mind of the dancer from Jaehwan's court, motions beyond grace, but now was not the time to dream of such things. Taekwoon had nearly captured the thief, but in a burst of frustration and determination when the thief had freed himself, he'd instinctively reached for the short sword he always carried. Taekwoon had attacked the thief who'd been fleeing. Surprised and now hurt, the thief had responded in kind. Wonsik had no reason to believe that the thief had been lying when he said he hadn't meant to do it. Given that they had found the knife not far away, it was fair to say that the thief had dropped it, likely unintentionally, possibly because Taekwoon had injured his arm in some way. He was sure that the thief had never had any intention to kill Taekwoon\u2014but he couldn't be sure if the thief had intended to injure Taekwoon in the way he had. And if he had, it was a blow that might have cost Taekwoon his eye, or killed him, had things played out in an extremely unlucky way. But perhaps it was fate that it had not.</p>\n    <p>There was no doubt in Wonsik's mind that he was a criminal. How could he not be, with all the things he had stolen. Had those crimes alone not been heavy enough, his attack on Taekwoon, however much Taekwoon had instigated it, would not look kindly on him when it came to the law. But Wonsik himself could not find it in him to hate the man for what he had done, even if Taekwoon was one of his dearest friends. He had never once spoken to him and knew far less about the man than he seemed to know of Wonsik. That was unnerving. He had seen him only twice, had met his eyes only once and that had been from a distance. Why then, was Wonsik so unkeen to condemn him? </p>\n    <p>It was not the gifts, whatever Jaehwan believed or said. Wonsik found them charming; they sat on a shelf in his room, but little else. The man was funny, likely young, self-declared to be handsome. Somewhat of a narcissist, unbelievably self-confident, a bit of a show-off. Kind, thoughtful, and talented beyond mere thieving, if that could be called a talent. And injured, and quitting, if he was to be believed. It made him feel even more the real. The blood on the cloth bundle was the most undeniable proof.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik sighed heavily, pouring himself yet another cup of wine. The sound filled the silence, and just as abruptly fled from it, leaving behind an echoing, empty space. </p>\n    <p>Perhaps he would ask Jaehwan to peruse some of the old case files that had never been solved. It was always a good exercise, a fun puzzle, regardless if they solved it or not, although it had taken Wonsik a while to accept that. Yes, Wonsik decided, he would do that upon Jaehwan's return. He would bring Taekwoon with him as well\u2014it wouldn't do for Taekwoon to coop himself up like this for too long. Nor was it good for Taekwoon to fixate so much on a single case. With what had happened, he would only be more so. Picking apart a puzzle may help. Keep him occupied until he could see patients again\u2014not even Taekwoon was daft enough to do so with an unhealed wound. Taekwoon may never have had formal schooling, but a seal was not what made one a good doctor.</p>\n    <p>And what, Wonsik wondered, would apprehending a thief who had said he'd be quitting, do. He knew Taekwoon's answer. He didn't know his own.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>The dancer's return was something that Wonsik had been anticipating with an eagerness he would never admit. The promised month was nearing its end; the latter half of the month had passed in a dull, sleepy manner. This was a hot summer, and the hazy heat seemed to smother the entire city in its oppressiveness. As quiet as those weeks had been, Wonsik was pleased that they had solved two old cases\u2014it had done much to improve Taekwoon's foul mood.</p>\n    <p>Irregardless of anticipation, the lethargy that permeated life left him caught completely unawares by that afternoon's visitor. </p>\n    <p>\"Your steward insisted your humble servant wait for the Young Master's return,\" Hakyeon said, eyes cast downwards. \"Your humble servant came to return the Young Master's horse and to say his thanks.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik gaped.</p>\n    <p>\"Sit, sit,\" he blurted out, gesturing at the chair.</p>\n    <p>\"Thank you, Young Master,\" Hakyeon said, straightening from his bow. His sleeves covered his hands as he did, retaking his seat with a sort of grace and fluidity that Wonsik would never achieve.</p>\n    <p>\"Young Master, you've returned!\" Wonsik snapped about as his steward walked in with quick steps. His steward's eyes twinkled with mirth as he bowed, in respect to Hakyeon's presence. \"I hope you don't mind that I asked this young master to await your return. I will presently have more tea sent for.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Please, Hakyeon will do, I am no young master,\" Hakyeon quickly said, but it was waved away, and just as abruptly, Wonsik and Hakyeon were again left alone.</p>\n    <p>\"Don't mind Kyungmo,\" Wonsik said with a sigh as he took the other seat. \"He's been with this household longer than I've been alive.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Steward Kyungmo has been nothing but kind,\" Hakyeon said. \"Your humble servant should not linger for long, the Prince has been kept waiting for far too long, and I cannot continue to impose upon his kindness.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'll go with you if you're worried,\" Wonsik said. He couldn't help but stare at Hakyeon.</p>\n    <p>If he had been surprised upon last seeing Hakyeon, then surprised was not enough of a word to express Wonsik's current state. Hakyeon was still wearing travel clothes, the hems stained lightly with dirt. It did nothing to dim Hakyeon's beauty, his skin glowing, his smile as charming as ever\u2014in a moment of poetic weakness, Wonsik wanted to liken it to the sun itself. It could not hide his slender form, and certainly could not conceal the elegance of his every motion. He was just as breathtaking as Wonsik had last seen him, if not more so. </p>\n    <p>\"Uh, so, your trip went well?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon inclined his head. \"Yes, with great thanks to the horse that Young Master lent me.\"</p>\n    <p>\"And your family, they're well?\"</p>\n    <p>\"They are well, and don't deserve Young Master's concern\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"Please, can we\u2014formality\u2014you don't need to here,\" Wonsik said, cutting Hakyeon off, stumbling over his own words. Everything was too sudden, and Wonsik's mind was struggling to keep up. It seemed to be a theme with this man. He was frowning, slightly, which he shook off and replaced with an expression that might be less foreboding. Wonsik sighed, scratching a little at the back of his neck. \"You can speak comfortably, and then Kyungmo might quit that too. It's awkward.\"</p>\n    <p>A small, playful smile, and the immediate sense of the line of Hakyeon's body relaxing. </p>\n    <p>\"As the Young Master demands,\" Hakyeon said, although the dull intonation of formality was now gone. Wonsik almost wanted to breathe a sigh of relief. </p>\n    <p>Silence fell as Wonsik strove to find the right words for such a situation. The last time they had exchanged any sort of prolonged conversation had been in a small guest room, surrounded by the darkness of night. In the clouded light of midafternoon, nearing evening as it was, mid-night encounters were as substantial as dreams, and Wonsik struggled with conciliating the two. Hakyeon's eyes fell on him, expectant, oddly silent. Wonsik wished that Hakyeon would say something, but he seemed utterly at ease with the silence.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik stood. Hakyeon's eyes followed him with surprise. \"Let's sit outside,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Outside?\" Hakyeon echoed.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll have Kyungmo send the tea out to us,\" Wonsik said. He proceeded towards the door, not waiting for Hakyeon, and it was a bare second later that the shuffle of fabric belying Hakyeon's movements followed.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik led them to the pavillion, gesturing for Hakyeon to first sit. Hakyeon hesitated, but as Wonsik stayed standing, he gathered his robes and sat, gazing about him with appreciation.</p>\n    <p>\"So this is what such a place looks like in the day,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"You've seen it in the night?\" Wonsik asked, somewhere between teasing and confusion.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon laughed, smiling at Wonsik mischievously. \"Not yours, I'm afraid,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"Would you like to?\" Wonsik blurted out before he could second guess himself. Hakyeon's eyes opened wide, in more genuine of surprise than Wonsik had seen Hakyeon show. But Hakyeon immediately bowed his head, looking away.</p>\n    <p>\"I am afraid that I have kept the Prince waiting far too long, and cannot delay anymore,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"Please don't,\" Wonsik said, a small groan of exasperation. \"If that's it, I'll send a message to Jaehwan. And it's getting late, it won't make a difference if you arrive in the morning. Have dinner and rest here tonight, and when you present yourself at court tomorrow you'll be fresher for it.\" Jaehwan would tease him to no end, but it was a sacrifice that Wonsik was willing to make.</p>\n    <p>\"I cannot possibly impose\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's not imposing,\" Wonsik said, cutting Hakyeon off. He eyed Hakyeon, trying to decide if Hakyeon truly did not wish to stay, or if his refusals were born of manners. Hakyeon, Wonsik was quickly learning, could be a difficult man to read.</p>\n    <p>It was at this moment that there was the sound of footsteps, and Wonsik turned to see Kyungmo approach with one of the serving girls in tow.</p>\n    <p>\"A good place to wait for a breeze,\" Kyungmo said. The serving girl placed the tea down on the table, before taking the tray with her and retreating with a bow. Kyungmo poured both Wonsik and Hakyeon tea, smiling at Wonsik as he did so.</p>\n    <p>\"Our Young Master has quite the discerning taste in teas,\" Kyungmo said to Hakyeon\u2014Wonsik's brows drew downwards in confusion, because he certainly did not, and knew nothing of tea. </p>\n    <p>\"As expected of such an accomplished young master,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"Please allow this old man to be presumptuous for a moment, but I could not help but to overhear you and Master Wonsik, and I too must insist that you allow us to provide you hospitality for the night,\" Kyungmo said, bowing towards Hakyeon.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik shut his eyes and resisted the urge to groan. \"Hakyeon, Kyungmo, can both of you please speak comfortably? And Kyungmo, you're not old.\"</p>\n    <p>His steward laughed, straightening. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Now, Hakyeon was it? If this rascal causes any trouble, send anyone for me and I'll sort him out. I'll have the cook prepare a little more for dinner, now if you'll excuse me.\"</p>\n    <p>This time, Wonsik did blow out a long exhale as Kyungmo swept away, his steps far too sprightly for someone who was old. \"Don't mind Kyungmo,\" Wonsik said again.</p>\n    <p>\"Should I worry about you causing trouble?\" Hakyeon asked, eyes twinkling. \"Being alone with you?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Of course not!\" Wonsik said. His face began to colour, and Wonsik rubbed at his ear. \"You don't have to stay, I don't want to pressure you, but if Jaehwan's your only objection, I'd like it if you did.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Would you now?\" Hakyeon asked, with a delicate arch of his brow. It soon fell away into a more serious expression, although a smile still sat on his lips.</p>\n    <p>\"But I would like to see this at night,\" Hakyeon said more softly, a small gesture to the courtyard about them. The sleeve draped from his wrist, having slid down his hand as he'd raised it. They were alone, and Hakyeon's next words were pitched only for Wonsik to hear.</p>\n    <p>\"And I'd like to see you too.\"</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>Wonsik's clothes did not quite fit Hakyeon, being broader across the shoulders, somewhat taller in the leg. It made the dancer look smaller, even more slender, and Wonsik sat back at the table as he watched him move about his room. Hakyeon paused in front of the shelf, eyes opening a little wide, a gentle smile tugging at his lips. Wonsik stood, coming about to see what it was that had caught Hakyeon's attention.</p>\n    <p>\"May I?\" Hakyeon asked at Wonsik's approach. It was the shelf on which he kept the things that the thief had left him. Wonsik nodded, and Hakyeon picked up the small clay bird whistle.</p>\n    <p>\"I had one of these when I was very small,\" Hakyeon said. He smiled at Wonsik, and it seemed to be a wistful one. The wistfulness soon melted away, Hakyeon replacing the whistle and inspecting the other items.</p>\n    <p>\"An odd collection,\" Hakyeon commented.</p>\n    <p>\"Is it?\" Wonsik asked. It was, of course. There was nothing in common between any of them, except for the giver, which Hakyeon would not have known. A glass flower, a cross-stitching, a wooden children's toy. An odd collection indeed.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon gave Wonsik a sly look, before he moved on down the row. Wonsik wasn't sure what conclusion Hakyeon had come to, and wasn't sure he wanted to know. </p>\n    <p>The trinkets aside, the remainder of Wonsik's room was as one would expect of a young man his age and stature. Wonsik returned to his seat, a low buzz spreading under his skin. He had invited Hakyeon to stay, and Wonsik could not deny that there had been more to his invitation than simple hospitality, although he would never dream of pressing, or even expecting. But it was Hakyeon who had asked to see Wonsik's room, although in such a way that Wonsik didn't even realise he was being asked until they were partway there. Wonsik could not help but to wonder.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik cleared his throat. \"I can send for some wine,\" he said, as Hakyeon turned about.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon's eyes crinkled lightly at the corners as he smiled. \"Would that help calm your nerves? You do seem a little anxious, Young Master.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Wonsik, I'd like it if you'd call me Wonsik,\" Wonsik mumbled.</p>\n    <p>\"Hm, Wonsik, is it?\" Hakyeon said. He moved away from Wonsik's shelf, to sit down across from Wonsik. He leaned forward, chin propped against interlaced fingers, elbows resting against the table. He smiled.</p>\n    <p>\"Since you did last time,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon laughed, eyes crinkling once again, almost childish in his glee.</p>\n    <p>\"Then, thank you for inviting me to stay, Wonsik,\" Hakyeon said. In a flash, Hakyeon was by Wonsik's side\u2014Wonsik didn't have a chance to utter a sound before Hakyeon had caught Wonsik's lips in a kiss, soft and gentle and slow. He melted against Wonsik, an arm about his waist. Hakyeon smelled of flowers, sweet. </p>\n    <p>\"You don't have to, I didn't mean, when I invited you,\" Wonsik said when Hakyeon drew back.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon huffed. \"Do not hurt my pride,\" he said. \"I'd do nothing I didn't want.\"</p>\n    <p>If that was the case\u2014Wonsik picked Hakyeon up, and carried him to the bed. This time, Wonsik was free to spend as much time as they liked.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>It was quiet, for a few months. Oddly quiet.</p>\n    <p>\"I keep telling you, take the exams,\" Jaehwan said as they walked. \"Then at least you get money and a fancy position for what you're already doing.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed. \"I haven't figured out what I want yet,\" he said. He smiled ruefully. \"My father's been pushing me too.\"</p>\n    <p>\"See!\" Jaehwan looked triumphant. Wonsik sighed heavily.</p>\n    <p>Summer had faded into autumn, heat dissipating into cool days and chilly evenings. They were returning to the palace, him and Jaehwan, after a busy visit in the city. They had visited the market, paid a visit to Taekwoon, and had drank well at a fine inn. As great as the palace was, Jaehwan was still a young man who enjoyed the excitement and bustle that only the city outside could provide.</p>\n    <p>It was much quieter here, although still there were children playing in the streets, but peddlers and merchants having already gone home to their own rest.</p>\n    <p>Much could change in a few months. With little else to do, Taekwoon had applied himself even more diligently to his medical studies, Wonsik helping him scour out rare texts, with Jaehwan's occasional input. There would be a scar on his face for the rest of his life\u2014less noticeable than it might have been, for Taekwoon had been diligent in tending to his own wound. He'd also started training twice as hard, often at Wonsik's manor; Wonsik would sometimes return home to find that Kyungmo had already let Taekwoon in. Wonsik had little doubt what was driving Taekwoon, and it set him ill at ease for more reasons than one. It had not helped when, a few weeks ago, a letter and a key had been slipped under Taekwoon's door. The crudely drawn map was familiar to Wonsik, only this time, it led to a small house in a town a half hour's ride away. In it, had been several of the things that had been stolen, as well as a letter apologising for those that were no longer in his possession and could therefore not be returned, and that the chicken was being well taken care of. Wonsik had tried not to let his disappointment show when Taekwoon had crumpled the letters in his hand and burned them before Wonsik could tuck them away with the others, kept in a small box in his room. Each thing had even been helpfully labelled with who it had been stolen from\u2014if Wonsik didn't have the memory for such things as he had, it would have been very helpful for returning them to their rightful owners. Wonsik was oddly touched. Taekwoon was expectedly livid.</p>\n    <p>As for Wonsik, little had changed in his home habits\u2014the time he spent at home, however, had. So, supposedly, had the time he spent with Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon settled into his small part at court within Jaehwan's quarters, like a newly planted flower might lend elegance and colour to a garden. A quiet addition, yet brought out to shine when needed, when Jaehwan wanted to impress, and impress he did. He seemed to spend most of his spare hours reading\u2014and the rest of his spare hours with Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>\"Is he here for my sake or yours,\" Jaehwan had complained, heaving a dramatic sigh. He'd grinned as Wonsik had spluttered, flapping his hand at Wonsik in dismissal. \"I like them taller and prettier anyway.\" Wonsik had had to bite his tongue to protest that Hakyeon was very pretty. He knew that wasn't quite what Jaehwan had meant anyway. That one girl, <i>absurdly</i> tall, hair like gold, foregin and exotic\u2014Jaehwan hadn't been the only one smitten with her. She'd seemed to find him cute\u2014she was probably at least ten years older than them both. Even Wonsik still remembered her. Quite a yardstick to measure any future love by.</p>\n    <p>It was autumn, but not so late that the sun had already set, that darkness had already set in. They would return to the palace before then. Shadows were already cast long, and soon the children would be called in, or scatter to their respective homes. Guards stood alert at the wide gates of grand manors, flanked by lanterns that would soon be brilliant in the night. Wonsik knew that he ought to post guards at his own home, but it was far enough out of the way that neither he nor his father had ever felt any need, especially now that there were no women who needed protecting. Wonsik, while not Taekwoon, was capable of taking care of himself.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik was listening to Jaehwan with only half an ear, his mind preoccupied with thoughts of the palace. To say that Wonsik had grown fond of Hakyeon would have been a bit of an understatement. It was difficult not to like the man. He had a quick mind and a quick tongue, made Wonsik laugh in one breath and then fluster in another. He was unbelievably self-confident, so much so that it sometimes left Wonsik speechless; the dip of Hakyeon's eyes in those rare moments when Hakyeon thought Wonsik to be asleep as he massaged whitening oils into his skin all the more striking for it. He was kind, thoughtful, and talented beyond the grace and elegance in his dance, if one could call Hakyeon's very life blood a talent. It was, Wonsik had come to learn, what Hakyeon knew of himself at his very core.</p>\n    <p>It's said that only when the roof is leaking will it rain, and that where one crow will fly surely another will follow. That evening, before the sun had set, as Wonsik listened to Jaehwan with only half a ear for his mind was preoccupied with thoughts of the palace, Wonsik would hear a name he had not heard for many years, and not in such a carefree manner for many more.</p>\n    <p>\"Hongbin!\"</p>\n    <p><i>Hongbin!</i> </p>\n    <p>His heart froze as his steps froze as time froze, and for a moment of a moment, Wonsik saw in front of him bright eyes and a bright laugh, eyes crinkled at the corners, mouth open wide.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm coming, I'm coming!\" A child's voice, and the stream of time tugged Wonsik back into the present and stepping out of the way of a young boy, a hoop and stick in hand. Bright eyes, a bright laugh, a boy chasing after his older brother, and the image from a moment ago has disappeared from Wonsik's eyes.</p>\n    <p>\"Wonsik?\" Jaehwan's voice, and Wonsik only then realised that he had stopped. \"Is something wrong?\"</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan's brows were deeply furrowed, his expression twisted in concern. Wonsik forced a smile, a small laugh, patted Jaehwan's arm, kept walking. </p>\n    <p>\"No I'm fine,\" Wonsik said. He took a deep breath, steadied his voice but his words had already come out, and there was no fixing them. Another smile, and Jaehwan's heart twisted for the sorrow in it even if Wonsik could not know. \"Hongbin's not a common name, is all.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Hongbin,\" Jaehwan repeated, the name slow and paced and unfamiliar on his tongue. His forehead still creased, his lip caught briefly between his teeth. Jaehwan had never had as complete a memory as some, but it was enough to have caught that name in its web, and was now fished to the surface by Wonsik's wistful ache.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh,\" Jaehwan breathed softly, remembering a night where they were younger and drunker and Wonsik had told him about a friend. A friend who'd abruptly disappeared, who'd Wonsik had never managed to find. \"He's...\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yeah, yeah he is,\" Wonsik said. </p>\n    <p>He blew out a long breath of air, his hand reaching automatically for his fan, only to remember he had forgotten it three nights before and would not have it again until tonight. It had not been with him for those three nights since, but it was only now that he noted its absence did its absence truly ache.</p>\n    <p>They walked the remainder of the way in silence, Wonsik sunk into what might have been thoughts and memories had they taken any form. It was before sundown that they returned, passing through the well guarded gates of the palace.</p>\n    <p>Only then, as they neared where Wonsik and Jaehwan often parted ways, did Jaehwan turn to Wonsik with a crooked grin.</p>\n    <p>\"Guess you're not joining me for more tea?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Good night, Jaehwan,\" Wonsik said firmly, tuning out Jaehwan's subsequent quip and comment about 'having fun'. It didn't stop him from blushing furiously.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>In the half light of the lanterns, the shadows cast across Hakyeon's face were dulled and blurred. Hakyeon had extinguished them earlier; it softened the room, swallowed the edges. Only one remained by the cloister of the bed, a candle set by the table for Hakyeon to write by. It was the first time Wonsik had seen Hakyeon write, he noted absentmindedly.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik still lay on the bed, sweat cooled and mostly dried. The months had lent him more familiarity with both this room and Hakyeon's gaze, and he had yet to clothes himself. Hakyeon, however, had gently left Wonsik on the bed and draped a cloak over himself, and had gone to sit at the table. He sat there now, his face part in profile, brush poised and straight in his hand, yet the paper had yet to be marked. The inkwell glistened in the light, the grinding of the inkstone having whispered through the room, many minutes earlier. Hakyeon himself had not stirred for some time, except to once place the brush down, and once again to pick it up. His hair was still damp by his neck, and Wonsik felt a surge of fondness for no tangible reason.</p>\n    <p>It had been good, and Wonsik's muscles were relaxed and loose. The usual drowsiness had come and gone, sleep just eluding Wonsik\u2014or perhaps it was Wonsik eluding sleep.</p>\n    <p>It has been said that things arrive in pairs, or that things follow in threes. There is nothing that comes in fours but ill fates and endings, and it is also said that it never rains but pours.</p>\n    <p>For Wonsik, that night could have been counted as any number of ways, but the first, undoubtedly, had been the calling of Hongbin's name, lingering as if a spectre in Wonsik's mind. The second could have been the door having been locked when Wonsik had arrived, the sound of something falling, of Hakyeon's muffled voiced frustration, before the door had opened and Hakyeon had been standing there as flawlessly put together as ever. The third, then, could have been Hakyeon's uncharacteristic silence, the way he paused just a second longer than he might usually have, the almost imperceptible dip of his brows that Wonsik might have missed had he not come to know Hakyeon, and had he not learned to read the most minute of changes that all but a few would pay no note to.</p>\n    <p>But let us say that this is a thing that comes in pairs, that this is a couplet with a first and a last, a counterpoint to the other, word matched for word, both opposite and alike. Let us instead write the start of this answering line to be Wonsik echoing Hakyeon's movements from minutes earlier, and coming to stand just by Hakyeon's shoulder.</p>\n    <p>\"Did you sleep well?\" Hakyeon asked. He tipped his head back, just enough to meet Wonsik's eyes with a playful shine.</p>\n    <p>\"Ah\u2014did I fall asleep again?\" Wonsik rubbed at his neck as he dropped himself onto the floor next to Hakyeon.</p>\n    <p>\"Well it certainly sounded like you did,\" Hakyeon said, tucking his hair behind his ear. \"Enough to wake a sleeping elephant.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I woke you, didn't I,\" Wonsik said ruefully. Hakyeon simply laughed, rested his arm about Wonsik's neck, gently massaged at Wonsik's shoulder.</p>\n    <p>The paper, Wonsik realised, was no longer blank. Instead, in great, bold strokes, was written a single word that Wonsik had come to know well, and yet had not seen in some time.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik, unable to help himself, smiled. He leaned against Hakyeon's side, his eyes falling shut for a brief moment, an odd mix of relief and resignation washing over him.</p>\n    <p>\"You know, well, I guess I should tell you, other than the scar, Taekwoon's fine,\" Wonsik said. His words were soft, off-handed, as unremarkable as Hakyeon might have been able to make them had it been Hakyeon speaking those same words.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon, however, could not hide his own lurch of surprise, the hitch of his shoulders, the sharp intake of breath that was quickly exhaled in a much slower one. </p>\n    <p>\"You knew,\" Hakyeon said. Relief, resignation. Rattled, awed. Something seeped out of him with those words, the tension that had been vibrating within him for the past three days and in particular this night, the moment Wonsik's two sharp raps on the door had sounded in his room. A small laugh, or perhaps it was simply a shaky exhale.</p>\n    <p>And then: \"how?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik rested his hand on Hakyeon's knee, reassuring, solid. His other hand came up against Hakyeon's back, and he traced a line just beneath his shoulder. \"This,\" Wonsik said, and then repeated the same motion down the length of Hakyeon's arm. \"And this,\" Wonsik said. Hakyeon shivered under his touch.</p>\n    <p>\"Too recent to be the follies of youth,\" Wonsik added.</p>\n    <p>\"Ah, are you saying I'm no longer young?\" Hakyeon asked, but his usual teasing tone carried too much weight to be carefree and airy. Wonsik could not see it, seated beside Hakyeon as he was, but Hakyeon allowed himself a rueful smile for him and him alone.</p>\n    <p>\"Since when?\" Hakyeon asked. Quiet, hesitant. He was not sure if he wanted to know.</p>\n    <p>\"Since that night,\" Wonsik said. Even if Wonsik had not smoothed his thumb across where, hidden beneath Hakyeon's sleeve, was a deep, red scar, Hakyeon knew which night Wonsik meant.</p>\n    <p>\"That,\" Hakyeon said, pausing for a moment, \"was a very long time ago. How...\"</p>\n    <p>\"You forget I'm an investigator,\" Wonsik said with a chuckle. \"Unofficial, but I'd like to think of myself as a rather competent one. The first was of course your wounds. I knew that Taekwoon had wounded the thief, at least once.\"</p>\n    <p>\"People are cut all the time,\" Hakyeon said, arching his eyebrows. Slowly, his easy manner was filtering back.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, but there's more,\" Wonsik said. He raised himself off the floor, dislodging Hakyeon's arm to sit on the table, having to push aside some things for the space. He met Hakyeon's eyes, taking in the surprise\u2014the worry. \"You <i>had</i> seen my courtyard before at night,\" Wonsik said. He followed it with a quiet chuckle. Creases formed between Hakyeon's brows before memory must have tugged at him, and his lips parted in a quiet 'oh'.</p>\n    <p>\"I shouldn't have said that,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik shook his head. \"I wouldn't have noticed if it weren't for everything else. It just, seemed like the kinda thing you would've said anyway,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"The kind of thing I would've said?\" A delicate arch of Hakyeon's eyebrows. Wonsik coughed and coloured, pushing on before Hakyeon could derail him.</p>\n    <p>\"And then you were too surprised, seeing the things\u2014ah, the gifts, I guess I can call them now,\" Wonsik said, his mouth twisting in a barely concealed laugh. Hakyeon laughed as well, but remained otherwise silent, giving, for once, Wonsik the chance to speak.</p>\n    <p>\"A bit too happy? Yeah, that's it,\" Wonsik said. There was a faint flush rising on Hakyeon's cheeks, and Wonsik wanted to ruffle Hakyeon's hair, as he often did to Jaehwan, or stroke his fingers through it. Later, perhaps. He had a question to answer, and too many questions to ask.</p>\n    <p>\"Then this,\" Wonsik said. He caught Hakyeon's hand in his and tugged it onto his lap, ignoring Hakyeon's small jerk of surprise. Wonsik brushed his thumb over the callouses on Hakyeon's palm, the space between his finger and his thumb, down the line of his wrist. He caught Hakyeon's hand between his, clasped it, revelled in his warmth. When he looked up and met Hakyeon's eyes, Wonsik nearly lost himself in their deep brown, darker for the way the light shone.</p>\n    <p>\"They're from holding a sword,\" Wonsik said, brushing his fingers again over the callouses.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon arched an eyebrow. \"I hold a sword to dance,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"I've seen you dance,\" Wonsik said. He turned Hakyeon's hand over, palm up. \"You wouldn't have these,\" a touch, \"only these,\" and another.</p>\n    <p>\"I suppose,\" Hakyeon said with a rueful laugh as Wonsik traced. \"But that's all conjecture and no proof.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Mm, did you know, I thought you looked familiar the first time I saw you,\" Wonsik said. He stared into Hakyeon's eyes, and this time, it was because he wanted to lose himself in them. He wanted to reach out and brush Hakyeon's eyelids, to kiss the corners of his eyes.</p>\n    <p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Your eyes,\" Wonsik said. \"I'd seen them before. I just didn't know where.\"</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon's eyes flickered wide, and then they melted back into a soft smile. \"I really slipped up that time, didn't I?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Show off,\" Wonsik teased. Hakyeon coloured wonderfully, and Wonsik laughed. \"Taekwoon wouldn't stop calling you one.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon, hm?\" Hakyeon hummed the name softly to himself. Wonsik hesitated, wondered if he should warn Hakyeon away from Taekwoon\u2014wondered if he should tell Hakyeon about Taekwoon's determination and stubborn personality.</p>\n    <p>There would be time for that, Wonsik decided. </p>\n    <p>\"If you knew for so long, why didn't you tell anyone?\" Hakyeon asked. Wonsik abruptly realised he was still holding Hakyeon's hand, when Hakyeon laced their fingers together.</p>\n    <p>\"I guess... I got fond of you?\" Wonsik said. He winced, knowing the words had not come out remotely like how he'd wanted them to, but Hakyeon merely laughed, his eyes crinkling into crescents, lines creasing his cheeks as his mouth stretched wide.</p>\n    <p>\"Fond of me?\" Hakyeon echoed, still laughing.</p>\n    <p>\"I wouldn't have anyway,\" Wonsik protested. \"I don't see much point in chasing someone who's already said they're not gonna steal anymore, and it's not like you did something horrible and kill someone or anything.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Mm, I did say that didn't I?\" Hakyeon said. He tugged at Wonsik until Wonsik slid off the table and onto Hakyeon's lap, and they were suddenly so close, Wonsik couldn't help but kiss Hakyeon. His lips were soft, and a smile curled up on them at Wonsik's touch.</p>\n    <p>\"You believed a nameless thief?\" Hakyeon asked when Wonsik drew away. His words tickled at Wonsik's nose, lingering in the breathspace between them.</p>\n    <p>\"I did want to ask, why 'fate'?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Ah, I suppose you must have questions,\" Hakyeon said. It was so fast gone that Wonsik might have missed it: disappointment, regret, sorrow\u2014the last out of place, yet undoubtedly present. He'd drawn back, rested a hand against Wonsik's cheek, the same callouses that Wonsik had previously traced with his fingers now familiar against his skin. Hakyeon chuckled and let his hand fall against Wonsik's thigh, warm and firm.</p>\n    <p>\"Mm, it's not so complicated. Across the sea, they call it <i>en</i>, it's pretty, right?\"</p>\n    <p>\"It is,\" Wonsik agreed.</p>\n    <p>\"And my... well, someone told me it was fitting for a thief. The thief's affinity with the thing is greater than theirs,\" Hakyeon said with a small laugh. \"And it's fitting now, isn't it\u2014what's this if it isn't fate?\"</p>\n    <p>\"You,\" Wonsik said, a quirk of his brows. \"You knew about me and Jaehwan, didn't you?\" Hakyeon's lips twitched in a smile.</p>\n    <p>\"You <i>are</i> fate,\" Wonsik said softly, and then promptly coloured at how cheesy his words were.</p>\n    <p>\"Yes, I suppose I am,\" Hakyeon said. For once, he only smiled and did not catch Wonsik's words and worry at it like a dog who didn't know how to let go, until Wonsik was spluttering and flustered. </p>\n    <p>\"Well then, since we've gotten all that sorted out,\" Hakyeon said primly, \"shall we go back to bed, love? After all this excitement, I'm not... quite tired enough to sleep, though.\"</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Love</i>?\" Wonsik repeated\u2014Hakyeon might as well not have said anything after that one word.</p>\n    <p>\"Well yes,\" Hakyeon said, laughing. He stood, scooping Wonsik up and carrying him to the bed like a bride, leaving Wonsik with no recourse but to sling an arm about Hakyeon's neck for fear of falling. But for all that Hakyeon appeared slight and slender, it belied a strength that was no less than Wonsik's.</p>\n    <p>\"I've had rather longer to... how did you put it, grow fond of you?\" Hakyeon said. He put Wonsik onto the bed and climbed up as well, straddling Wonsik's waist, eyes twinkling as he looked down at him, hair falling about over his shoulders. But then he caught his lip in his teeth, a crease forming between his eyes. \"I won't call you that, if you don't want.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, no,\" Wonsik said. \"I... it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. If you want.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Thank you,\" Hakyeon murmured. He leaned down, kissed Wonsik gently, no less so than Wonsik had kissed him earlier. Their foreheads touched, and Hakyeon smiled.</p>\n    <p>\"For?\"</p>\n    <p>\"For trusting me,\" Hakyeon said, and kissed Wonsik again. This time, it was long minutes before either of them said anything again.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\"You're drinking again?\" Wonsik frowned as he followed Taekwoon in. It was always easy to tell\u2014a single sip would send a pink flush to Taekwoon's cheeks.</p>\n    <p>\"I knew you'd come,\" Taekwoon said simply.</p>\n    <p>\"How?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Intuition,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik sighed as he sat, while Taekwoon went to fetch a second cup for Wonsik. It was easy to tell when Taekwoon was lying as well. At least Taekwoon prefered the softer, sweeter wines. They went to his head less.</p>\n    <p>Papers were spread across the table, Taekwoon's chicken scratches filling almost every blank space. Wonsik slid the top few over a few inches to reveal a map of the city below. He hadn't known that Taekwoon had one.</p>\n    <p>\"What's this?\" Wonsik asked as Taekwoon returned, knowing full well the answer.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon shrugged, pouring wine out for Wonsik. \"Jaehwan gave it to me,\" he mumbled, knowing full well that wasn't what Wonsik had meant.</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Taekwoon</i>.\" The corners of Wonsik's mouth tightened but Taekwoon met his eyes briefly before he poured himself another cup. </p>\n    <p>Jaehwan. Wonsik hadn't been expecting that. Jaehwan hadn't mentioned Taekwoon to Wonsik at all\u2014it ought not to have mattered, yet it was odd nonetheless. Yet Wonsik didn't doubt that Taekwoon was telling the truth about Jaehwan; he could think of no other way Taekwoon would have it.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik sighed, raising his cup to Taekwoon in acknowledgement before drinking it.</p>\n    <p>It was only several minutes of comfortable silence later did Wonsik realise how long it had been since they had had such nights. There was nothing silent about time spent with Jaehwan, and the nights spent with Hakyeon were only silent in the moments when Hakyeon had fallen asleep, his lips slightly parted, his expression utterly at peace.</p>\n    <p>He had even begun to take books with him on occasion, merely to sit in Hakyeon's presence, or to watch as Hakyeon practiced. There were times he'd take home with him small pieces of clues, and then bring them with him as he walked over to Hakyeon's, Hakyeon sometimes offering a thought or two. He only used to do that with Taekwoon.</p>\n    <p>The changes that could occur in a moment were startling. It had been only days ago that Hakyeon had admitted to Wonsik who he had been, prior to becoming Jaehwan's dancer. Something that Wonsik had known for some time, but he would never have pressed Hakyeon on it, even had Hakyeon never said a thing. And yet, it was as if a veil had been drawn away, a veil that neither Wonsik nor Hakyeon had even known existed.</p>\n    <p>But tonight was not a night for such thoughts of Hakyeon.</p>\n    <p>The scar on Taekwoon's face was no longer raw and angry, but was still jarring to look at. Sometimes, Wonsik would catch Taekwoon rubbing at it absentmindedly. His hair had grown longer, his bangs now falling over his eyes, pushed mostly to one side.</p>\n    <p>\"Is it really so wrong of me to want to catch him?\" Taekwoon's question was soft, strangely hesitant. Wonsik swallowed, but Taekwoon was not looking at him. He sensed that Taekwoon was not finished and only sipped at his wine, letting it burn in his throat. </p>\n    <p>\"You, Jaehwan, everyone says I should let it go. As if I'm the one who's in the wrong, to try to chase him down.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I think,\" Wonsik said, a silence falling behind those two words. His voice in this small space sounded even the more gruff, for following after Taekwoon's. There was anger and hardness in Taekwoon's words, yet it could scarcely be heard in his voice unless one knew what they were looking for. It could be said to be one of Taekwoon's charms, one of those incongruities that made Taekwoon who he was.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik sighed again, a great breath leaving him all at once. \"I don't think anyone thinks you're in the wrong, Taekwoon. We just don't like seeing you like this.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Like what?\" Taekwoon asked. His eyes narrowed, almost imperceptibly.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik caught his lips between his teeth as he carefully thought over his next words. There were other reasons why Wonsik wished Taekwoon would let this go, and it niggled guiltily at him. But even before Hakyeon, hadn't Taekwoon already said that Wonsik hadn't seemed to want to catch him? </p>\n    <p>\"Like you have a grudge,\" Wonsik finally said. He watched Taekwoon, ready to move as soon as Taekwoon lunged for him across the table, but Taekwoon merely sighed, all the hardness seeping out of him in that one, slight sound.</p>\n    <p>\"That's what Yixing said too,\" Taekwoon murmured. His lips quirked in irritation. \"Jaehwan called me an idiot.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I hope you didn't hit him,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon snorted. \"The brat probably would have called for guards,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"Give the guy more credit than that,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"I do.\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon was staring off into space again as he said this, and there was something more behind his words that Wonsik did not feel right asking about. He would tell Wonsik when he wanted to. </p>\n    <p>Something had changed between Taekwoon and Jaehwan after that night, when blood had run down Taekwoon's face and Jaehwan had cringed away from it. \"It was stupid, what he did,\" Jaehwan had told Wonsik later, again, like he hadn't said it before. \"I wouldn't think he'd go that far.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Jaehwan's just worried,\" Wonsik said. \"Even if he doesn't act like it. He didn't like seeing you hurt any more than the rest of us.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I know.\" The answer followed Wonsik's words without a missed beat, slipping into the space between them.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik picked up the flagon and refilled Taekwoon's cup of wine.</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon,\" Wonsik started, and then he paused, brows furrowing unconsciously. He caught his next words and then swallowed the thought, so that when Taekwoon looked to him, Wonsik was shaking his head to himself.</p>\n    <p>\"Tell me,\" Taekwoon said. </p>\n    <p>\"It's not important,\" Wonsik said. Taekwoon scoffed.</p>\n    <p>\"Which means it is important,\" Taekwoon said pointedly. \"To you.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I suppose,\" Wonsik said with a low laugh. \"Not important right now, though.\"</p>\n    <p>\"If it weren't, you wouldn't have brought it up,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't, did I?\"</p>\n    <p>\"You started, so you have to finish.\" Taekwoon nudged Wonsik's half finished cup of wine towards him, as if he needed the drink to say whatever it was he had to say. It made Wonsik laugh, that\u2014Taekwoon could be unexpectedly cute at times.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik obligingly picked up his cup and took a sip. He held it in his hands for a moment longer, the ceramic cool against his skin.</p>\n    <p>\"'What's Hongbin doing?' I thought that recently.\" He felt Taekwoon jerk away, even though Wonsik was still staring down at the clear wine in the cup. \"But then I thought '<i>is</i> Hongbin doing?' and I couldn't stop myself.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed, but it was one with no mirth, an attempt to fill space that he hadn't meant to make or leave, and that only bloomed when Wonsik unrightly assumed it would follow. The way the wine burned in his throat was always a pleasant one. He'd been young the first time he'd drank\u2014really drank. One became a man, Wonsik learned that night, when they had lost too much. It had been the one kindness his father had shown him when it came to Hongbin. Wonsik still remembered it: the moon had been a bare crescent of silver and his father had called Wonsik out with him to see it. There were two cups on the table. His father had poured him wine before Wonsik could think to do it himself, and then he'd smiled at Wonsik, and told him it'd be the one and only time.</p>\n    <p>That had been a long time ago.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed again, the same, dry laugh from moments earlier, only this time, it was to ease out of the silence that he himself had created. \"I told you, it's not very important.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's been a while,\" Taekwoon said softly. </p>\n    <p>\"A while?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Since you spoke about him.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Perhaps I've had too much wine,\" Wonsik said with a small chuckle. He quieted, his lips quirked. \"I heard his name the other day.\"</p>\n    <p>Taekwoon's breath hitched at that. \"It's not a common name,\" he said, and Wonsik nodded.</p>\n    <p>\"That's what I told Jaehwan too,\" Wonsik said. \"Startled me, that's all. Couldn't help but think about it, even if it's not important.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Do you miss him?\" Taekwoon asked, but immediately shook his head. Outside, there were rarely times when Taekwoon spoke without thinking over his words at least three times over, but with Wonsik, there were times when he blurted out the first words that came to mind. He had meant: \"do you miss thinking of him?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I don't know,\" Wonsik admitted. He drained the wine this time, and let Taekwoon pour him more. It was warm inside him. Perhaps he wished he'd had too much wine, for there to be a better reason for him to be speaking of this.</p>\n    <p>\"You miss missing him,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik laughed. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"It's different from...\"</p>\n    <p>\"He's not dead,\" Taekwoon said, and Wonsik knew that Taekwoon had filled in Wonsik's unspoken words. Memories of light silk and gay colours, girlish laughter and the warmth of an embrace that Wonsik had long stopped seeking comfort in even before it had been taken from him. </p>\n    <p>\"I have to think that, don't I?\" Wonsik murmured. He shook his head as if to clear it, but the hazy glow within him was comforting.</p>\n    <p>There was the sense of a conversation ending, and Taekwoon did not extend it, did not tease it out. It was something that Wonsik cherished in Taekwoon. Spending time with Taekwoon was so different than spending time with Jaehwan\u2014and when had it become that it was only with these two that he had grown to live his life around? No, Wonsik knew the answer to that, but even the greatest minds could lie to themselves sometimes, and this was not an outright lie nor was Wonsik remotely one of the greatest minds. And there was a third, now, and how quickly could such changes happen. There was a third, and Wonsik was tired of losing.</p>\n    <p>He poured Taekwoon another cup, and Taekwoon filled his again. </p>\n    <p>\"I do have a question,\" Wonsik said. Taekwoon glanced up at him, and Wonsik glanced down at the papers, forgotten. \"If it's not a grudge, why do you want to catch him so much?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Hah, I should have known you would ask,\" Taekwoon said, half under his breath, without so much a look at Wonsik. Instead, his eyes drifted down to where Wonsik's gaze was fixed. </p>\n    <p>\"Why shouldn't I? He's a criminal, why shouldn't I want to catch a criminal? He broke laws, and if no one else will catch him, then I will,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n    <p>\"You make it sound so simple,\" Wonsik said ruefully.</p>\n    <p>\"Because it is.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You've always been stubborn,\" Wonsik said. \"The more we tell you to let it go, the less you will.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's not like I have anything better to do,\" Taekwoon muttered. His shoulders were hunched a little, almost defensive.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik wouldn't know, afterwards, why he said what he did. Perhaps it was because he'd been thinking about Hongbin. Perhaps it was because he'd been thinking about the past. Perhaps it was because more than anyone, he knew what Taekwoon was like, he knew that Taekwoon would stop at nothing to get what he wanted, and Wonsik wanted nothing more for Taekwoon not to want this. It was cruel, uncalled for, and the moment the words left his mouth he wished he could take them back, he wished he could have never uttered them.</p>\n    <p>Because what he said was: \"have you given up on your sister?\"</p>\n    <p>The worst of it, the worst moment, is that as Wonsik braces for Taekwoon's anger, as he knows he deserves every bit of it\u2014the worst is that it never comes. The worst is the way Taekwoon shakes his head in a no, and then he shakes his head again, but every inch of Taekwoon's body screams yes, and Wonsik wants to gather Taekwoon into the tightest hug. He abruptly looks so small and young, and tired and old at the same time, and this is so cruel of Wonsik, because he knows that Taekwoon has lost no less than Wonsik.</p>\n    <p>But Wonsik didn't. He watched Taekwoon shake his head, and saw the way his hands clenched into fists. Sat silently as Taekwoon bit at his lip, so hard as if he wanted to draw blood, but Taekwoon knew as well as Wonsik that no blood would come.</p>\n    <p>The worst was that Wonsik watched Taekwoon do all this for seconds upon seconds until time drew itself long like the shadow of an evening falling into night, before he finally, finally moved to Taekwoon, finally moved to sit next to him. How did one define the 'worst', when there was no part of a moment that was not better than any other? Because perhaps the worst is that when Wonsik wraps his arms about Taekwoon, pulls him against his chest, knows that Taekwoon is strong and broad and yet he feels, in this moment, as slight as Hakyeon\u2014perhaps the worst is how Taekwoon does not pull away from him and curls into Wonsik instead, his body shuddering in Wonsik's arms.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik had been the poison, but his words had so shattered Taekwoon, that Taekwoon still clung to him as a cure.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>As if a mirror, the moon was a crescent low in the sky, the dog of darkness having slowly eaten across its surface until only a single silver sliver remained. They could not see it well now, hidden behind the veil of the window, surrounded by bright lamp light. It washed out the darkness beyond these walls, and with it, the bare glow from the moon.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't know he had a sister,\" Jaehwan mused. </p>\n    <p>Jaehwan played with the cup between his fingers, tracing out the rim with one delicate tip. Like often, Wonsik found himself drawing comparisons with Taekwoon. He had once commented that Taekwoon had pretty fingers, he recalled. It was a fact that could not be disputed, but Jaehwan's fingers were nice in their own way. Not quite as long nor slender, but still well shaped.</p>\n    <p>Odd thoughts, these.</p>\n    <p>\"I shouldn't have told you,\" Wonsik mumbled. They'd pushed aside the low wooden board, the chess pieces put safely away and rested on top of its smoothed surface in their respective boxes. \"Taekwoon wouldn't want me to.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's why no one knows?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I don't know,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Why do you know?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik exhaled a shaky laugh. \"It's why we met, you know. Why he came to find me. Thought I could help him. Couldn't.\"</p>\n    <p>\"He had a sister,\" Jaehwan said again.</p>\n    <p>\"Has,\" Wonsik said, like a reflex.</p>\n    <p>\"But she's been missing for years,\" Jaehwan said. He frowned, his brows creased, his face serious and Wonsik wished it wasn't, suddenly wished they weren't talking about this. Jaehwan wasn't drunk, not by a long shot, but his tongue was loosened and Wonsik wasn't sure he wanted to hear Jaehwan's next words. \"It has to mean that she's dead.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, it doesn't,\" Wonsik said. \"It doesn't mean that. Taekwoon's wrong, he can't give up on her.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You don't think it's a little unfair?\"</p>\n    <p>\"That I think his sister is alive?\"</p>\n    <p>\"No. You want him to let go of one case you can't solve, but not let go of the other. And one is more likely to be solved than the other.\" Jaehwan's eyes were clear and hard when they met Wonsik's. Wonsik glanced away, down at his own cup. It was empty when he tipped it slightly, the light reflecting off the bottom, no wine to ease its shine. </p>\n    <p>\"I hate when you talk sense,\" Wonsik said, voice low and words barely articulate.</p>\n    <p>\"I always talk sense!\" Jaehwan preened, wrinkling his nose at Wonsik for good measure, but the moment fell away far too quickly. This room was too filled with words and thoughts that could not accommodate such things, could only let them slide off and melt away. It was not too much of a surprise for Wonsik, what Jaehwan's next words were.</p>\n    <p>\"It's because of Hongbin, isn't it?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Do I need to answer that?\"</p>\n    <p>And that, that was an answer in itself.</p>\n    <p>The hardness that had been in Jaehwan's eyes had disappeared, but his words had still been detached, as if Jaehwan was afraid of claiming them. It was not very much like Jaehwan, who was so often careless with his words, who so often let his words be a little careless to make people laugh. He liked making people laugh. He was a good kid like that\u2014he'd always try to cheer up those he cared about in whatever way he knew. Clumsy, at times. It was all part of what made Jaehwan, Jaehwan. A more refined Jaehwan would have seemed out of place.</p>\n    <p>He was being careful with his words now, and Wonsik would honour and acknowledge that. </p>\n    <p>Hongbin. It all came back to Hongbin.</p>\n    <p>Everything did, if Wonsik were honest with himself, and it was easy to be honest with himself at times like this. He would not be here, drinking with the Eleventh Prince, speaking of Hongbin, had it not been for the friendship that Wonsik and Hongbin had shared as children, had it not been for the way that friendship had\u2014no, it had not ended, nor had it vanished. Wonsik would never let it, even if he didn't know what Hongbin thought. He could only hope that Hongbin felt the same.</p>\n    <p>It did not feel so long ago, that evening when he'd walked with Jaehwan and had heard that name called out, like a spectre from the past. Much had changed since that night, and so in some ways it did feel very long ago. It did not feel so long ago that he had walked with Jaehwan; it felt like it had been half an eternity since Hakyeon had so precariously picked up a brush, and trusted Wonsik with his life.</p>\n    <p>\"Your face is pink,\" Jaehwan suddenly said.</p>\n    <p>Wonsik's eyebrows shot up, and he met Jaehwan's eyes. Jaehwan only shrugged, his head tilted a little as if in thought, brows creased as if studying Wonsik with great care.</p>\n    <p>\"It is,\" Jaehwan said. \"It's very pink.\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik couldn't help but laugh. \"Is it?\" he said, as he reached across the table to refill Jaehwan's cup. He hadn't meant to fill his own, but it was habit and courtesy that did it, and there was nothing for it but to raise his cup to Jaehwan and drink.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not wrong to say that Hongbin and I grew up together,\" Wonsik said after a moment. \"But Taekwoon had only his sister. Is it really so wrong that I don't think he should give up searching for her?\"</p>\n    <p>\"He asked me something like that\u2014was it really so wrong that he didn't think he should give up on catching the thief? That's what he asked me,\" Jaehwan said. His cup was still full, and he made no move to drink from it yet.</p>\n    <p>\"He asked me the same thing,\" Wonsik said, and then he laughed in the way where one laughed when there seemed to be little other response to their own words. He'd known, of course, that Taekwoon had asked Jaehwan that very question.</p>\n    <p>\"It isn't wrong,\" Wonsik said, \"but it's different. What will come out of catching the thief? He's returned what he can\u2014but if Taekwoon could find his sister...\"</p>\n    <p>\"Maybe,\" Jaehwan said very slowly, his eyes finding the table and becoming entranced by the polished surface, \"he doesn't want to find his sister.\"</p>\n    <p>Had Wonsik's mind not been dulled by drink, perhaps he may have been able to catch on the thread of Jaehwan's meaning. But whether he had chosen that night the soft haze that wine lent, or if it had been the acquired consequence of the pleasant warmth it bestowed, Wonsik could not have been sure. Is it not so often the truth, when it comes to such nights, no matter if it is the woodcutter or the Emperor himself who questions it?</p>\n    <p>Yet, even had his mind not been dulled by drink, he may have willfully feigned ignorance, because it is often easier to do so.</p>\n    <p>And so: \"I don't understand,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>And so: \"Would you rather find Hongbin dead, or continue to think he's alive?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n    <p>It may have been spoken as a question, but it was not a question. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik might have sharply gasped\u2014it would have been the appropriate response for such harsh words. His breath instead caught in his throat, choking. His hands balled into fists, his head was bowed, his eyes, he'd find later, were squeezed shut. </p>\n    <p>Jaehwan's eyes had been on Wonsik when he had spoken those words, but they fell again to the table. It was a difficult thing, to acknowledge that one had wounded a friend, and even more difficult to know that the words he'd spoken had been intentional. He could not know that it had been only two days earlier, that Wonsik had done the same. </p>\n    <p>When Wonsik finally spoke, his voice, he found, was low and unsteady. \"Do not ask me to answer that,\" he said. And then: \"do not ask Taekwoon to answer that.\"</p>\n    <p>Because Jaehwan had never known when to stop, when it would be better to let a thread of conversation fall, he said: \"you already asked him that.\"</p>\n    <p>It was true, of course, but in the moments before Wonsik had spoken, Wonsik had already known that truth.</p>\n    <p>Heat was prickling at his eyes, and Wonsik squeezed his eyes shut tighter, bit at his lip and willed himself to draw blood, but his teeth and nails both too blunt to do so. Life was not fair\u2014so much of life was not fair; one could be born as a woodcutter or an Emperor, and the woodcutter could live a life that was uneventful and hard and surrounded by his family, while the Emperor could have risen to the throne at the death of his brothers, at the hand of his father's wife. The Heavens were kind as they were cruel, senseless as they were whimsical, and all that was fated would happen and that had brought them all to here.</p>\n    <p>\"That was... I'm sorry, Wonsik. That was unkind of me. It was something I cannot have you forgive me for\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"Don't Jaehwan, if you have any care for me, don't,\" Wonsik choked out. He did not miss Jaehwan's slip into formality, into the stilted language of the court; it was hard to miss. It meant that Jaehwan was at a loss, that he knew he'd fucked up, and Wonsik ought to reassure him, but he could no more find the words for it, any more than could Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>So he looked up, ignoring the red in his eyes, and reached for Jaehwan's cup as nearly full as it was and pouring it to the brim. Wonsik was as much at a loss. </p>\n    <p>Wonsik picked up his own cup, raised it to Jaehwan. He spoke words that were all but prescribed, and took support from it, if there was no comfort to be taken. \"I drink to you, and the kindness you have always shown us,\" he said, and then drank it dry. Jaehwan, almost thankful, acknowledged Wonsik and drank as well.</p>\n    <p>And as such, the moment passed. Calm fell over them both. Calm and stillness, and then Jaehwan said something, and Wonsik said something, and Jaehwan said something that made them both laugh. Wonsik grabbed Jaehwan in a headlock and ruffled his hair, and Jaehwan whined and then lay down in Wonsik's lap, and let himself be fussed over in a very put-off manner.</p>\n    <p>The night was far from young when Wonsik finally stood. They had again fallen quiet for quite some time.</p>\n    <p>\"There's a bed,\" Jaehwan said, as if there wasn't always a bed. He yawned, stretching, and clambered to his feet as well.</p>\n    <p>\"No,\" Wonsik said, \"I'm gonna go.\"</p>\n    <p>\"What? It's too late for you to go home,\" Jaehwan said. \"I'm gonna make you stay\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not going home,\" Wonsik said. \"It's too far.\"</p>\n    <p>Jaehwan frowned for a moment, and then his eyes opened wide in realisation and he nodded. \"I get why you don't want to stay,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"No, Jaehwan, it's not you,\" Wonsik said. A flash of guilt, sadness, Wonsik couldn't tell had surfaced briefly in Jaehwan's eyes, in the way his lids had settled heavily. \"I'd... I'd just like to go.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Alright,\" Jaehwan said. He nodded. \"I can walk you.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Save that for your lover,\" Wonsik teased. He wasn't unsteady, but the world was still hazy in front of him as he let Jaehwan at least walk him to the door. </p>\n    <p>The palace at night was always quiet; at times Wonsik found it eerie, at times he found it peaceful. No matter how quiet the city at night could get, there was always some hint of life. Here, with so much life sheltered behind walls and gates and then walls and doors, night was simply a void that Wonsik alone seemed to fill.</p>\n    <p>The clouds had drawn a veil over the sky, and the moon which would now be low in the sky had disappeared. There were no lights on when Wonsik reached his destination; something he noted only after he first tried the door to find it locked, and then knocked at it, calling softly inside.</p>\n    <p>And yet, it was bare seconds later that there was the sound of quick steps, and then the door opening much like it had months ago.</p>\n    <p>\"Wonsik? This is a surprise,\" Hakyeon said\u2014a mirror of months ago, only this time it was hushed by the night and it was real surprise on Hakyeon's face. He had clearly been asleep, dressed in only a thin robe, his hair unbound and tumbling messily down his back. </p>\n    <p>\"I... Sorry, I woke you,\" Wonsik mumbled. He should have stayed with Jaehwan.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm a light sleeper,\" Hakyeon said. He ushered Wonsik into a darkness more complete than the night outside. It didn't last long; Wonsik soon found himself blinking away starbursts.</p>\n    <p>\"Did you miss me that much?\" Hakyeon asked. He led Wonsik to the table\u2014Wonsik wasn't sure if he'd rather have been brought straight to bed. Wonsik wasn't quite sure what he wanted.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't realise how late it was,\" Wonsik said. It sounded lame to his own ears. Of course he'd known it was late. Jaehwan had said it was late. </p>\n    <p>\"You were drinking with Jaehwan,\" Hakyeon said. It was as if he'd been reading his thoughts. Wonsik frowned, and Hakyeon reached over the table and brushed hair away from Wonsik's face. \"You smell like alcohol, and you must have come from Jaehwan's, it's too far for you to have come from anywhere else.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You should be an investigator,\" Wonsik said. Hakyeon laughed, and patted Wonsik's shoulder.</p>\n    <p>\"Here, let me get you some tea,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"Why did you become a thief?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>There was the sudden clink of ceramic against itself, and then them both being placed down on a wooden tray.</p>\n    <p>\"We all have to eat somehow,\" Hakyeon said. He knelt by Wonsik, his sleeve brushing against Wonsik's arm as he leaned over and placed the tea down. Hakyeon was very close as he poured tea for Wonsik, and just as close as he sat by him, on the floor.</p>\n    <p>\"You're an investigator, and I was a thief,\" Hakyeon said. \"But I'm not one anymore.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not actually an investigator,\" Wonsik admitted. \"Not officially at least. Don't get paid for it.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Mm, I do seem to recall that. Imagine my surprise when I find that the two men hot on my tail weren't even sent properly by the court. And imagine how pleased I was to find how attractive one of you were,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm\u2014Taekwoon's the attractive one,\" Wonsik mumbled.</p>\n    <p>\"Would you like me to sleep with him instead?\" Hakyeon murmured, his voice low and by Wonsik's ear. He laughed before Wonsik could even properly react, and placed a hand on Wonsik's thigh. \"I'm teasing, love.\"</p>\n    <p>\"My answer to your question doesn't change\u2014we all have to eat somehow, and the world isn't so kind to let us live for free,\" Hakyeon said. He followed his words with a sigh, and gently stroked down Wonsik's leg. \"I don't think that's the answer you were looking for.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Taekwoon wants to catch you,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon smiled, eyes falling briefly shut. \"He does seem the type,\" he said. \"That scar of his doesn't help, does it?\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, it doesn't,\" Wonsik said with a chuckle.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon rested his head against Wonsik's side. </p>\n    <p>\"Why didn't you stay with Jaehwan?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I...\" It wasn't, Wonsik was sure, because of Jaehwan himself. He had told Jaehwan as much, and he had not lied. He picked up the cup between his hands and sipped at the tea. It didn't clear his mind much, but Wonsik was starting to think it was less from the wine, and more from the hour. It was a detached thought; there was always that part of Wonsik's mind that made such observations, that stashed and stored them away even when Wonsik's mind was otherwise occupied.</p>\n    <p>\"I wanted to come here,\" Wonsik said. His voice was low and gruff and almost hesitant as he said this, but this too was true. It wasn't the true answer to Hakyeon's question, but it was difficult for Wonsik to give Hakyeon an answer when Wonsik himself could not give form to that answer himself.</p>\n    <p>\"You spoke of something with Jaehwan,\" Hakyeon said. Wonsik startled and pulled away, his eyes meeting Hakyeon's as he looked down, eyes wide. A smile of some sort curled the corner of Hakyeon's mouth, but it was not one of joy or amusement.</p>\n    <p>\"You're too perceptive,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Trade hazard I'm afraid,\" Hakyeon said. \"Or I'd be captured or dead a long time ago, and neither seem very pleasant.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No,\" Wonsik agreed. \"I wouldn't like that either.\"</p>\n    <p>\"What a thing for an investigator to say,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"Not official,\" Wonsik reminded him. He found himself carding his fingers through Hakyeon's hair\u2014when had he started to do that? But there seemed to be no reason to stop, and Hakyeon had only leaned into him more. Warm, solid, comforting. Familiar, despite how short these few months had been. </p>\n    <p>\"I had a friend,\" Wonsik said, and then paused, brows creasing immediately into a frown. \"Have.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You don't have to speak of it to me,\" Hakyeon said. \"That isn't what I meant.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I don't have to,\" Wonsik agreed.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon unpressed himself from Wonsik's side and came to stand behind him. Wonsik let himself be tugged backwards until he leant against Hakyeon, caught Hakyeon's hands with his as Hakyeon draped his arms across Wonsik's chest. His eyes fell closed; Hakyeon pulled one of his hands free and brushed it through Wonsik's hair.</p>\n    <p>\"If it weren't for what happened to Hongbin, I don't think I'd have ever met you,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"You've been drinking,\" Hakyeon said. He grasped Wonsik's hand with one hand and stroked through Wonsik's hair with the other. He laughed a little. \"So maudlin.\"</p>\n    <p>\"So let me be,\" Wonsik said. \"Trying to find him, it's why I started investigating\u2014'cause no one official would do it. But I was a kid. My dad, he thought, I... I don't know, but he asked me to look into a case, and I solved it. I couldn't find Hongbin, but I could solve a murder. Strange way to distract your son.\"</p>\n    <p>He could still remember that. Could remember begging his father to help him find where Hongbin had gone, could remember his father telling him <i>do you know where he lives? Who his family is? How would you expect anyone to find him? Our men are busy enough without searching for someone like him. No, it's about time you grew up and stopped playing with street urchins, son.</i> </p>\n    <p>\"You've been drinking,\" Hakyeon said again. Something in his voice sent a pang through Wonsik's heart, it was too tender, Hakyeon's voice was too tender. </p>\n    <p>\"I stopped looking for him a long time ago,\" Wonsik said\u2014the words were an admission that Wonsik didn't know he had. He laughed, short and bitter. \"Makes me a bad friend, doesn't it.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, no it doesn't,\" Hakyeon said. He pulled Wonsik to his feet and Wonsik went, and for a brief instant, Wonsik thought he might have seen tears glisten in Hakyeon's eyes. Yes, he had been drinking, but he'd walked all the way here. He was clear minded enough for that.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon led him to the bed, and sat him down on the edge of it. Wonsik shook his head\u2014\"come, I'd never take advantage of you like this. Sleep and we can speak in the morning.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I won't want to in the morning,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Then it's better not to say it at all, rather than regret it tomorrow,\" Hakyeon said firmly.</p>\n    <p>\"It won't be regret,\" Wonsik said. \"I... I won't be brave enough.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You are a strange man, Kim Wonsik,\" Hakyeon said. He began to undress Wonsik slowly, and Wonsik let him. It was familiar. How strange that it had become familiar.</p>\n    <p>\"Didn't think we'd go past that one night,\" Wonsik said, as he moved his arms to let Hakyeon pull his undershirt off. He shivered as the autumn night hit his bare skin.</p>\n    <p>\"Mm? Even though you knew Jaehwan wanted to\u2014ah, how did you put it, 'keep me'?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Didn't think you'd want to,\" Wonsik murmured. \"Thought you were doing it because you couldn't refuse me.\"</p>\n    <p>A sharp irritated noise\u2014followed by a hard pinch of Wonsik's arm that had him yelping. \"I would not do something like that, if I didn't want to,\" Hakyeon said. There was fire and ice in his eyes, and Wonsik stared at him wide-eyed, but just as quick was it gone, replaced by a soft, apologetic smile.</p>\n    <p>\"Did you know, me and Jaehwan?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh? Is there something between the two of you I don't know about? I'm hurt, Wonsik, am I not enough for you?\" Hakyeon teased, mocking such a wounded tone that Wonsik couldn't help but fluster.</p>\n    <p>\"I mean, that Jaehwan and I were friends, that\u2014\"</p>\n    <p>\"Yes I did. Do you really think I'd walk in so unprepared?\"</p>\n    <p>\"So, you...\"</p>\n    <p>\"I thought I was done already,\" Hakyeon said softly. He ran a hand down Wonsik's back, his callouses catching on Wonsik's smooth skin. \"I wanted to speak to you, and I was tired of running. But I couldn't refuse the last one, and look where that got me.\"</p>\n    <p>\"You were very hurt,\" Wonsik said. He fumbled, reaching for Hakyeon's arm, because their limbs weren't in the right places.</p>\n    <p>\"It wasn't so bad,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"You bled all over my doorstep,\" Wonsik said wryly.</p>\n    <p>\"It was only a scratch,\" Hakyeon said. Wonsik laughed at the affront in Hakyeon's tone, gave up on finding the right one of Hakyeon's scars.</p>\n    <p>Words bubbled under Wonsik's skin, surrounded by the warmth of Hakyeon's touch, the half-glow of a single mid-night lantern. Words, so many words. He hadn't spoken of this in so long. It had been so long ago. A decade, almost. How much time had passed. How old they had all grown. He caught his breath, and then caught his breath again. That night could have been said to be a couplet, and the couplet could be said to have been the opening to a poem, waiting for a second couplet to match it in every way. There was no poem\u2014there was only Wonsik with words and memories.</p>\n    <p>\"I told Taekwoon that\u2014I can't say that. I heard Hongbin's name the other day, I haven't thought of him in so long, it made me realise.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Shh, shh,\" Hakyeon murmured into Wonsik's hair.</p>\n    <p>He was crying, Wonsik realised, there was heat in his eyes. He laughed, shakily, and how embarrassing for Hakyeon to see him like this. Hakyeon was merely a dancer, Wonsik ought to be the strong one, and here he was, being comforted because of memories he thought he'd already forgotten, but hadn't meant to ever forget.</p>\n    <p>\"Sometimes I think I've forgotten him too,\" Hakyeon said. \"No, not your Hongbin. He was my... student? Apprentice? My little brother, yes, he was my little brother. Is. See, I did that too.\" Hakyeon sighed, a deep sigh that reverberated against Wonsik. </p>\n    <p>\"What happened to him?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Mm? I don't know,\" Hakyeon said. He exhaled again, as if there was an answer in that breath itself. \"Haven't seen him in years. I had to... I had to stop looking for him eventually. I've stolen from imperial villas and military generals, but he's always been the one thing I've never been able to steal back. And Hongbin, is he the one case you've never been able to solve?\"</p>\n    <p>Wonsik nodded. The rhythm of Hakyeon's words had soothed him, calmed him, and now with everything having piled up to this moment, sleep was tugging at him, urging him to put this all down and descend into calm oblivion, to wake in the morning with this night fallen into the haze of memory. But then Wonsik shook his head, and felt for Hakyeon's hand that had fallen again onto his thigh.</p>\n    <p>\"There's you,\" Wonsik said. \"I never got to catch you.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon hummed, \"or I wouldn't be right here, would I be?\"</p>\n    <p>There was a truth to Hakyeon's words, but it was not the one that Wonsik thought. Memories were a strange beast, a cat curled up in the corner that refused to sleep, yet so quiet and still one often forgot that it was present, until a quiet call brought it close, to rub its head against your leg, demanding attention. A cat was warm, soft, comforting, but its weight would always be there when it'd settled on your lap, and at times, unwilling to be dislodged, it will dig its claws into your legs before finally leaping off to return to its corner. A cat was calming in its very presence, like the arm that Hakyeon still had about Wonsik. He ought, Wonsik thought through the insistence of sleep, hold Hakyeon in the same way for he knew from the shaky breath Hakyeon had taken that memory had taken hold of Hakyeon as well. But he had drank with Jaehwan that night, and he had come to find Hakyeon, and there was a significance in that itself.</p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <p>- \u263e -</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\u00a0 </p>\n    <p>\"She wasn't this noisy at home,\" Wonsik said sheepishly.</p>\n    <p>He looked down at the little white dog in Hakyeon's lap, her incessant yaps resounding in the room. She'd even been quiet through the trip here in the carrying cage.</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon's eyes crinkled at the corners as he looked up at Wonsik with a delighted laugh. \"Isn't she just excited to see me?\" he asked. His smile softened as he looked down at the dog, and Wonsik's heart melted at the sight. \"She'll calm down, won't she.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I think so?\" Wonsik said.</p>\n    <p>\"Look, she already is,\" Hakyeon said, and she was, resting her head against Hakyeon's leg and curling up almost like a cat. Her yaps slowly died down to the occasional snuffle as Hakyeon continued patting her head.</p>\n    <p>\"You're just full of surprises,\" Hakyeon said, still smiling down at the dog. \"But this might be the biggest one of all.\"</p>\n    <p>\"She won't grow much bigger,\" Wonsik said. He didn't think Hakyeon had the space to care for too big a dog.</p>\n    <p>\"Where did she come from?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n    <p>\"A friend asked me to take care of her,\" Wonsik said, \"but I thought, maybe you'd like a companion.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Oh? You think I'm lonely?\" Hakyeon asked, a teasing quirk of his brows. \"Are you not going to come so much, should I name her Wonsikkie?\"</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not going anywhere,\" Wonsik protested. He could feel a flush rising in his face, and an odd desire to cover it. </p>\n    <p>\"What's the real reason?\" </p>\n    <p>\"That is the real reason,\" Wonsik said. He caught his lip between his teeth, knowing that it wasn't the answer that Hakyeon was seeking. There were always reasons behind reasons. Yes, Taemin had asked him to take care of his dog because he was being posted to the border, and yes, Wonsik had thought that it would be good for Hakyeon to have a companion.</p>\n    <p>\"It's just that other than me and Eunji, you don't talk to anyone. Jaehwan doesn't come by very often either,\" Wonsik said slowly.</p>\n    <p>\"No, Jaehwan's never touched me once,\" Hakyeon said, and Wonsik's heart jerked at that.</p>\n    <p>\"Do you... do you want him to?\" Wonsik asked. \"I think it's because of me that he won't.\"</p>\n    <p>Hakyeon laughed quietly, so as to not disturb the dog. \"The Prince is a very attractive man,\" Hakyeon said. \"But I rather like not having to sleep with more than one man\u2014\" Hakyeon's hand flew to his mouth, his fingers curled, and he just as quickly shrugged it off with a small laugh.</p>\n    <p>\"You're quite enough to satisfy me,\" Hakyeon said with a sly smile.</p>\n    <p>Heat flushed to Wonsik's face again. \"Is it alright for you to take care of her?\" he quickly said before the conversation could fall in a direction that Wonsik would never be able to rescue himself from. He found that such things happened far more often than he'd like, when the conversation was being had with Hakyeon. Hakyeon had just said something he hadn't meant; Wonsik knew that, he'd be a fool to not but he also was not so cruel as to pick at it. It was with almost a breath of relief that Hakyeon nodded. He was still patting the dog, and Wonsik had not known it was possible for Hakyeon to have even more tender of an expression than Wonsik had already seen on him.</p>\n    <p>\"It'll be my honour,\" Hakyeon said. \"Thank you.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Good, I'm not sure Kyungmo would have been too happy taking care of her,\" Wonsik said, heaving an exaggerated sigh of relief. \"He's more of a cat person.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Oh? That's surprising,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n    <p>\"Huh, why?\"</p>\n    <p>\"He seems fond of you, and you seem more of the dog type,\" Hakyeon said. His lips curled at the corners. \"Good thing I'm a dog person, hm?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Take good care of her,\" Wonsik said, refusing to rise to the bait, even if something fluttered in his heart.</p>\n    <p>\"Of course I will,\" Hakyeon said. \"Especially as it's you who entrusted her to me; but I would treat her well regardless.\"</p>\n    <p>\"This isn't related to her,\" Wonsik started to say. He interrupted himself with a deep breath, unsure of how Hakyeon would react. Hakyeon met his eyes quizzically, a slight tilt of his head. \"But thank you, for that night.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Which\u2014oh, oh Wonsik, that's nothing that should be thanked,\" Hakyeon said. \"If I didn't have Fluffy on my lap here, I'd tell you to come here so I could give you a hug.\"</p>\n    <p>\"<i>Fluffy</i>?\" Wonsik gaped at Hakyeon. \"You've already named her?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Why, is Fluffy not a good name? She's very fluffy,\" Hakyeon said, a small pout on his face of complete innocence. \"Ah, unless you did want me to name her Wonsikkie? Is it okay to give a girl a boy's name though\u2014but if you want me to name her Wonsikkie, of course I can name her Wonsikkie.\"</p>\n    <p>\"No, Fluffy is fine.\" Wonsik groaned, putting his face into his hands.</p>\n    <p>\"Good,\" Hakyeon said, sitting up straight, exceedingly pleased with himself. \"I'll take good care of Fluffy. Hm, I do hope Eunji is alright with dogs.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Where is she?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"Off talking to Chorong I think,\" Hakyeon said. \"Since there's not much for her to do here right now.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Your serving girl socialises more than you do,\" Wonsik said with a sigh. \"That isn't right.\"</p>\n    <p>\"What isn't right about it?\" Hakyeon asked. He scratched Fluffy behind the ears, and the dog snuffled.</p>\n    <p>\"Is this really what you wanted when you came to Jaehwan?\" Wonsik asked.</p>\n    <p>\"It's too early for all these hard questions,\" Hakyeon said lightly.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't mean it to be,\" Wonsik said, rubbing at the back of his ear in discomfort. He exhaled deeply. Sometimes, speaking with Hakyeon was like being in a spring storm, sun one moment and rain the next, a brisk wind fading into nothingness and then swirling about once again. Sometimes, it was an autumn evening, cool and brisk after a burning summer. Sometimes there was no conversation, simply Hakyeon's body against his, sleek and beautiful in every way, and Wonsik loved those moments as much as any.</p>\n    <p>But Hakyeon was also an enigma, a puzzle that Wonsik couldn't solve, and that Wonsik wasn't sure he wanted to solve. At times, he was abruptly aware of how much Hakyeon knew about Wonsik, and how little Wonsik knew about Hakyeon. He knew that Hakyeon was a dancer, that Hakyeon revelled in the every movement of his body, of the control he had, of his love for performing.

Text:</h3>\n          <div class=\"userstuff\"><p>Taekwoon let out a content sigh as he saw off the last fans and headed back into the dressing room. As much as it felt regretful to finish any concert or fanmeet, he was <i>tired</i>\u2014and the fans who'd pledged to grow old with him (and who'd spent the past ten years growing old with him) seemed ready to go home and sleep as much as he did. Some of the staff seemed more energised than the fans did, and Taekwoon briefly envied their youth as he thanked them gratefully for all their hard work.</p><p>\"Your carriage awaits, m'lord,\" Minseok greeted him cheekily as Taekwoon returned.</p><p>\"You came!\" Taekwoon hugged his friend, almost draping himself over Minseok's sturdy shoulders.</p><p>\"Told you I would,\" Minseok said, patting Taekwoon on the back. \"Sorry I couldn't say hi earlier.\"</p><p>\"I'm just glad to see you,\" Taekwoon said earnestly. \"I've been <i>so</i> busy.\"</p><p>\"Have you thought about working less?\" Minseok teased. \"Grab your things and we can head out, I think the staff want to close up here and go home too.\"</p><p>Taekwoon nodded and said his round of goodbyes and thank yous, and in no time at all they were in Minseok's rental car and on the way back to the hotel. It was a short drive, and Taekwoon, now fully relaxed, let the words flow out of him (in Korean) faster than his thoughts could keep up as Minseok nodded along.</p><p>\"<i>Meditate</i>, can you believe what the staff put for the yes-no game?\" Taekwoon said indignantly.</p><p>\"Maybe you could give it a try,\" Minseok suggested as he pulled into the parking structure. \"Make it your new year resolution.\"</p><p>\"Every time I try I fall asleep,\" Taekwoon said sulkily. \"Even if it's not at bedtime.\"</p><p>\"Ah, well, it's the thought that counts,\" Minseok said.</p><p>They kept their hands to themselves up the elevator and down the hall and into the room but that was as far as they got before Taekwoon bent down to nuzzle against Minseok's neck.</p><p>\"I'm tired,\" he whined.</p><p>Minseok pat Taekwoon comfortingly on the back. \"Too tired for some wine?\" he asked, as he pushed him slightly off so he could get his coat off.</p><p>Taekwoon pursed his lips as he considered this, shedding his own coat. \"Maybe,\" he decided. \"Depends on the wine.\"</p><p>\"Have I ever brought anything you don't like?\" Minseok prodded Taekwoon out of the entryway and Taekwoon reluctantly went, without flopping all over Minseok because the hotel's couch wasn't too bad and he wanted to flop on that instead.</p><p>Truthfully, Taekwoon was less interested in the wine and more interested in pulling Minseok down onto the couch with him. Minseok tumbled easily into Taekwoon's lap, eyes twinkling as he let his bag fall onto the floor.</p><p>They were both naturally touchy people, although Taekwoon reserved his true clinging to a select few. The problem with being so busy, and with all those select few being so busy, he'd been sorely deprived of his needed cuddle time.</p><p>\"No wine then?\" Minseok teased, but he leaned his forehead against Taekwoon's, grinning.</p><p>\"Maybe later,\" Taekwoon said, hands sliding up Minseok's back. He made a face and glowered as they came to rest on the sturdy muscles of his shoulders.</p><p>\"Stop going to the gym so much,\" he complained to Minseok's laughter. \"You're worse than Jaehwan!\"</p><p>\"I do it just to make you mad,\" Minseok said solemnly, lips still twitching in amusement.</p><p>\"I'm not mad,\" Taekwoon said, pouting. \"I just don't understand how you <i>do</i> that.\"</p><p>\"By not being a giant,\" Minseok said, placing a mollifying kiss against Taekwoon's lips. Taekwoon sighed into the kiss, his hands coming to rest against Minseok's waist.</p><p>\"You're not so bad yourself,\" Minseok said, pushing Taekwoon's shirt up, hands roaming across Taekwoon's chest. \"I don't mind noodles.\"</p><p>Taekwoon huffed, pulling his hands back to cross his arms. \"Stop making fun of me,\" he whined. After a moment of consideration, he quickly tugged off Minseok's shirt and then his own in succession, tossing it carelessly beside him while staring straight into Minseok's eyes like a cat pushing a vase off a drawer while making sure the human knew <i>exactly</i> what he was doing.</p><p>Minseok quirked his eyebrows but didn't comment. But he did flex his muscles, watching like a cat that'd got into the cream when Taekwoon swallowed, eyes unable to look away from Minseok's chest.</p><p>\"Unfair,\" he muttered, but didn't complain when Minseok pushed him down flat onto his back, or when Minseok straddled his waist, lips curling. Taekwoon reached up, feeling Minseok's muscles shift under his palm. He sighed happily, finally giving in to the smile that'd been threatening to bloom the entire time.</p><p>Minseok was <i>very</i> pleasant to look at.</p><p>\"Done ogling?\" Minseok asked, tweaking Taekwoon's nipple and making him yelp.</p><p>\"That <i>hurt</i>,\" he whined, but he pulled Minseok down into a hungry kiss, tangling his fingers in Minseok's hair.</p><p>Minseok hummed, moulding his body against Taekwoon's as he kissed into Taekwoon's mouth, tasting him thoroughly. He gasped when Taekwoon pushed his thigh against Minseok's crotch, heat immediately winding in his gut.</p><p>\"Brat,\" Minseok muttered, pulling back just far enough to meet Taekwoon's pleased gaze without going cross-eyed. He pressed a fond hand against Taekwoon's face, running a thumb against his cheekbones. Taekwoon reciprocated, his fingers pressing gently down on Minseok's neck to guide him down. Minseok kissed Taekwoon's forehead, and then the tip of his nose, and then nipped Taekwoon's lip. Hard.</p><p>Taekwoon whimpered, but that was all he had breath for before Minseok kissed him, intense and messy. He squirmed underneath Minseok's solid weight, held in place between Minseok's fingers tangled in his hair, and a hand on his waist. He gasped for breath and Minseok took brief mercy on him.</p><p>\"Minseo\u2013 <i>ah!</i>\"</p><p>Minseok palmed Taekwoon's cock through his jeans, Taekwoon arching up at the touch with a sharp gasp.</p><p>Taekwoon whimpered as Minseok mouthed down the line of Taekwoon's jaw, leaving soft and gentle kisses against the side of his neck, ones that wouldn't mark. Taekwoon bared his neck, whining Minseok's name. Minseok rewarded him with a light scrape of teeth\u2014but nothing more.</p><p>\"You're on stage in a week,\" Minseok reminded him, the words brushing against his collar bone.</p><p>\"I'm\u2026 I'm wearing\u2026 a shirt,\" Taekwoon managed between sharp breaths.</p><p>Minseok laughed at this, but to Taekwoon's disappointment, didn't give in. He trailed his kisses lower, over his sternum, down the center line of his (noodle) body, palming Taekwoon through his jeans all the while.</p><p>Taekwoon reached down but Minseok slapped his hands away.</p><p>\"Take them off,\" Taekwoon whined, scrunching up his face. \"Too tight.\"</p><p>\"Your thighs make up for your ass,\" Minseok commented as he obliged, Taekwoon lifting his hips to let him pull his jeans off all the way. He sat up, leaving Taekwoon feeling very bereft of warmth as he neatly folded Taekwoon's pants and set them aside.</p><p>It was very unfair. Especially after: \"why does everyone make fun of my ass \ud83d\ude22\u201c</p><p>\u201dI'm not making fun of it, it's just a fact,\" Minseok said, very seriously. \"Besides\u2013\"</p><p>Minseok finished that sentence not with words, but by biting lightly down on the sensitive inside of Taekwoon's thigh.</p><p>Taekwoon groaned, legs falling open as Minseok worried at the same spot, his lips leaving what was sure to be a vivid bruise. Taekwoon squirmed in place, words choked out by gasps of pleasure. He dug his fingers into the couch but there wasn't much give.</p><p>\"Please please please,\" Taekwoon begged, sparks firing across his skin and down to the tip of his toes, as the wet heat of Minseok's mouth moved closer but not close <i>enough</i>. Minseok had the gall to chuckle, his breath playing warm against Taekwoon's cock.</p><p>\"<i>Please</i>,\" Taekwoon whined.</p><p>Minseok smacked Taekwoon's leg, when he tried to hook it around Minseok's waist and drag him closer.</p><p>\"Don't do that,\" he scolded.</p><p>\"But\u2013\"</p><p>\"Don't.\"</p><p>Taekwoon subsided with a whimper and a piteous look. His cheeks were flushed bright red and there was a hint of sweat at his temples, his lips wet with spit. Minseok stretched up for a quick kiss against those sweet, pink lips and Taekwoon's heart swooned in fondness.</p><p>A fondness that was immediately overwhelmed by <i>need</i> when Minseok dipped down, this time to suck a bruise against the sharp line of Taekwoon's hip bone.</p><p>\"Ah\u2013!\" Taekwoon cried out and then clamped a hand over his own mouth. He couldn't remember how sound proof this room was. It was a pretty fancy hotel so the walls should be\u2013he bit down on his fist to be safe.</p><p>He swallowed as Minseok did the same on the other side, leaving Taekwoon's skin tingling with the pleasant bite of heat and gentle pain. He was making sounds, he knew he was, pathetic whines that rumbled in his throat instead.</p><p>\"Minseok, <i>please</i>,\" Taekwoon gasped, moving his fist for a moment, before immediately clamping down on his own hand when Minseok fucking finally took Taekwoon's aching cock in his mouth.</p><p>A brief moment of hilarity as he considered what'd happen if he showed up backstage with puncture marks and a bleeding hand, but that was quickly absorbed by the heat of Minseok's mouth around his cock.</p><p>Taekwoon squeezed his eyes shut and desperately held on.</p><p>He was going to last five seconds like this. It was like he didn't have a body anymore, he just had Minseok's mouth on his cock and it was every sensation all at once, his entire body coiled up in anticipation. He reached blindly for Minseok's shoulder, gripping as tight as he could.</p><p>He hoped it'd been at least five seconds.</p><p>Taekwoon shuddered as he came into Minseok's mouth, his hand falling limp and forgotten as he cried out in little, throaty sounds. The tingling spread from his cock to his whole body, like warm, molten gold spilling through his veins. Minseok didn't work him into overstimulation (like some people would, whether or not Taekwoon was <i>really</i> in the mood for it or was perfectly fine leaving it there), and was suddenly kissing him again, the taste of Taekwoon's cum still in his mouth. Taekwoon's entire body was jelly, and he tipped his head back to kiss into Minseok's mouth.</p><p>\"You taste good, hm?\" Minseok asked, as he kissed him insistently.</p><p>\"Mmhmm,\" Taekwoon agreed, swiping his tongue against Minseok's lips. \"Good.\"</p><p>Minseok laughed, letting his weight fall against Taekwoon's chest, as Taekwoon's arms came up to hold him and Minseok snuggled into them like the space was for him, specifically.</p><p>In this moment, it was.</p><p>\"Love you,\" Taekwoon murmured sleepily, turning to press a soft kiss against Minseok's forehead.</p><p>\"Love you too, you big sap,\" Minseok replied. He stroked fingers through Taekwoon's hair, thinking about moving them both to the bed.</p><p>Well, maybe a short cat-nap first wouldn't hurt. Minseok licked his lips, rather pleased with how the past few hours had gone, and let his eyes fall shut as well.</p><p>If they didn't wake up until morning, complaining about sore backs and aching bones\u2026 well, that was a problem for tomorrow morning.</p></div>\n        <!-- end cache -->\n    </div>\n<!--/chapter-->\n\n\n  </div>\n  <!-- END work skin -->\n<!-- END work -->\n\n<!-- BEGIN comment section -->\n<!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.

Text:</h3>\n          <div class=\"userstuff\"><p>Zagreus wasn't <i>too</i> surprised anymore to find Meg in his room, or Than, or, as had happened before, both of them at the same time.</p><p>Even so:</p><p>\"Uh, this is my room?\"</p><p>\"Oh, we can tell from the mess,\" Megaera said, raising an eyebrow. Something approximating a smile flickered across Thanatos' face.</p><p>\"Don't worry Zag, if you cleaned up, the gaudy wall hangings would serve the same purpose,\" Thanatos added.</p><p>Zagreus groaned. \"Great. I love getting tag teamed.\"</p><p>\"Oh? Do you now? Because I couldn't tell,\" Megaera said, and her voice had taken on the angry tone usually reserved for Tartarus, and when Zagreus had done something especially egregious.</p><p>\"Uh oh, what'd I do this time?\"</p><p>\"Hm, I thought you had a better memory than that, Zag. A whole half hour ago and you've already forgotten?\"</p><p>Half hour...? Ah.</p><p>\"You're not still mad about losing... right? We passed the big five oh a while back. I thought we were over the whole killing each other repeatedly thing, except mostly it's me killing you.\"</p><p>\"Keep it up and you won't even make it out of your room,\" Meg said.</p><p>\"So not about me killing you, got it.\" Zagreus glanced over to where Thanatos was standing with his arms crossed, expression a tiny bit amused, as amused as Thanatos could get. Oh. \"Oh. C'mon Meg, fair's fair. Do you see me complaining about all those wretches  you keep summoning? Or every time your sisters show up?\"</p><p>\"You know they only show up because of the Pact of Punishment. The one that you sign.\"</p><p>\"Right. Well. The wretches. Than, back me up here!\"</p><p>\"No, Zagreus, you're the one who called.\"</p><p>\"You just like watching me suffer.\"</p><p>\"I have to admit I do enjoy watching you talk yourself into a hole like this,\" Thanatos said. Great. Now the literal personification of death was laughing at him.</p><p>\"Really, Than? Rea--rgk!\"</p><p>Zagreus's hands flew to his neck, desperately trying to pull free from the choking pressure of what was undoubtedly Megaera's whip. Worked about as well as he expected, wasn't too surprised when his knees hit the edge of his bed and he tumbled back onto it.</p><p>Well, it wasn't like his bed got much other use out of it. Shame, when the Contractor had put so much effort into the sheets. Would be nicer if he could breathe, though.</p><p>\"Don't kill him just yet,\" he heard Than faintly from behind the haze. The pressure immediately vanished and Zagreus coughed in relief, as he rubbed his bruised neck reflexively.</p><p>\"I wasn't planning on it,\" Megaera said. Oh boy. He was in for a world of pain.</p><p>\"Alright, alright, I yield,\" Zagreus said, raising up both hands. The ceiling was looking mighty appealing.</p><p>\"That's a good boy.\" Megaera leaned over him and crooked her finger towards her. Zagreus obediently shuffled over until he was lying on the bed. Thanatos was still standing in the corner, watching the scene unfold like it was a particularly interesting thespian endeavour.</p><p>A particularly intersting thespian endeavour featuring Megaera's whip, apparently, when he found his arms tugged up and apart, whip wrapped tightly about each wrist.</p><p>\"Hey, I have blood, remember? I can't feel my hands. Circulation and all that,\" Zagreus found himself protesting.</p><p>\"Don't worry, I haven't forgotten, <i>redblood</i>.\" Alecto's nickname for him in Meg's voice sent shivers down Zagreus's skin. At least, the parts of it he could feel.</p><p>Suddenly, Thanatos was looming over him. He'd shed the cloak, but for some reason, his giant sickle was still on his back. Okay, now it was in his hand.</p><p>\"Ever think about growing your hair out again, Than? Really, it did look better, doesn't need to be as long as Meg's here. And did you really need to teleport three steps?\"</p><p>\"Believe it or not, I walked those three steps,\" Thanatos said. \"Careful, it's not too late for your neck to make a better aquaintance with this.\"</p><p>\"What happened to not killing me just yet,\" Zagreus said. The sharp, pointy end of the scythe pricked the soft part of his throat. He heard Megaera's low chuckle somewhere beside him, but he didn't dare to look.</p><p>\"It doesn't mind waiting,\" Thanatos said. Said sharp, pointy end pressed down harder, until blood began welling up and pooling against his skin. The pressure retreated fairly quickly, but Zagreus didn't have time to breathe a sigh of relief when the sharp, pointy end of the scythe drew a slow line down his chest, slicing neatly through his shirt.</p><p>\"Hey, I don't have an endless wardrobe like my dad,\" Zagreus said. He didn't dare wiggle, and when his hands tried to instinctively protect the soft part of his belly, Meg's whip tightened about his wrists. Ow.</p><p>Thanatos chuckled. \"I'm sure we can find you another shirt somewhere. If you insisted.\"</p><p>\"Personally I would feel better if you put down your giant sickle, but maybe that's just me,\" Zagreus said. \"I mean, what you do with your giant sickle in your own time is--\"</p><p>\"Does he always talk this much, Than?\" Megaera asked, languidly cutting him off. \"Or should we shut him up?\"</p><p>\"I think that can be arranged,\" Thanatos said.</p><p>\"Hey, don't be like that, you two,\" Zagreus protested weakly. He might've had more to say, but Megaera went ahead and took the initiative, covering Zagreus' lips with her own. Zagreus gasped into her mouth as her tongue pushed into his. Her hands gripped his bared shoulders, fingers pressing bruises into his skin.</p><p>He was faintly aware of Thanatos at the other end of the bed. Hopefully he'd left his scythe against the wall or something like he usually did. Any thoughts along those lines were faint and hazy, because unfortunately his part mortal side meant he really needed to breathe. When Meg pulled apart, Zagreus coughed, desperately sucking air into his neglected lungs.</p><p>\"Wouldn't want to end the fun too early,\" Meg murmured, words brushing against his cheek.</p><p>Thanatos, while Zagreus had been busy trying to breathe, had relieved Zagreus of his pants.</p><p>Not particularly surprising, given the circumstances, but it would've been nice if Thanatos had <i>asked</i>. Zagreus would submit a formal complaint once he got around to breathing again, or he would've, if the literal personification of death hadn't started palming at his cock while the punisher of oathbreakers kissed him again, hungry and possessive.</p><p>He'd have to wait to complain about being tag-teamed.</p><p>\"Shall we try something new, Zag?\" Megaera asked, pulling away just enough for Zagreus to stare into her golden eyes. She didn't wait for him to reply, simply patting his cheek in a strangely gentle gesture. Thanatos's fingers squeezed the base of Zagreus' cock, taking any words out of his mouth anyway, his back arching and eyes involuntarily closing.</p><p>The next thing he knew, it was suddenly very hard to breathe <i>again</i>. He opened his eyes to momentary darkness, before registering Meg's looming shadow. The familiar musk of her pussy overwhelmed him, yanking him back into the moment of what was <i>happening</i>. Oh gods. And Zagreus couldn't push her away even if he wanted to.</p><p>(He didn't.)</p><p>\"Effective,\" Thanatos commented. Meg's laughter vibrated through her body. Her thighs clenched around Zagreus's cheeks and he had to remember to breathe.</p><p>He tried to tongue at her, the way he knew could undo her under his touch if he was particularly good at it.</p><p>\"Not this time,\" Meg said. The whip wrapped around his wrists tightened to make her point, only relaxing when he let his mouth fall lax. She started moving in a slow, lazy rhythm, fucking his face with no regard for if he could breathe, occasionally covering his entire face between her legs.</p><p>His fists clenched and opened uselessly, his moans entirely muffled by her pussy. His toes curled and his knees rose as his back arched, but Thanatos's long, bony fingers put an end to that as well.</p><p>\"Sorry Zag, not this time,\" Thanatos said, in a dead-pan echo of Megaera that was all the more mocking for it.</p><p><i>What do you mean?</i> Zagreus would've asked, if he had any brain cells left. (He didn't. Meg was fucking them out of him.)</p><p>As if hearing his thoughts anyway, Thanatos chuckled. He positioned Zagreus's legs apart, spread much like his arms were spread, his grip on Zagreus's ankles as firm as Meg's whip was on his wrists. He desperately wished he could see Thanatos, but he had to satisfy himself with brief glimpses of Meg's face and hearing her low, breathy moans. Zagreus was wound up so tight that Thanatos' cock pushing into his ass almost hurt as it forced apart the ring of muscle. Thanatos gasped, loud and echoing in Zagreus' chambers.</p><p>\"Blood and darkness Zag, relax,\" Thanatos muttered, settling deep inside of him. Zagreus didn't really know how to respond, and wasn't sure he <i>could</i> relax. Thanatos hadn't let go of his ankles either, forcing his legs up uncomfortably high. He couldn't be sure if it was in retaliation or if it was unconscious, but Thanatos was holding his ankles so tightly that Zagreus knew he was going to end up with quite a few marks after today.</p><p>Good thing he was probably off to die again soon! Come back good as new!</p><p>Meg's low laugh interrupted her rapid breaths. Her pussy was wet and warm, and Zag desperately wanted to lick it off and swallow deeply around her, but that wasn't she wanted, so he let it coat the inside of his mouth, gathering on his tongue.</p><p>\"Unlikely you'll be getting your wish anytime soon, Than,\" Meg said.</p><p>\"Hah. Can't say I mind too much,\" Thanatos replied.</p><p>Zagreus squeezed his eyes shut as Thanatos started moving inside of him, his cock forcing him open, pressing against his walls. A silenced yell worked its way through Zagreus' body, vibrating against Megaera's pussy. She gasped in turn, her thighs crushing around Zagreus' skull.</p><p>Thanatos set up a strong, slow rhythm, breaking down any resistance Zagreus' body was unconsciously putting up. He'd finally let go of his ankles, his fingers toying with Zagreus' cock, thumbing at his balls, the head of his cock leaking pre-come that Thanatos smeared down his erect length, and up his bared belly and chest.</p><p>\"Wet already?\" Thanatos asked, playing with the tip of Zagreus' cock. As if he hadn't been torturing him for what felt like hours at this point.</p><p>\"Surprised... surprised he hasn't already come,\" Meg said, between her own moans. \"You're enjoying this... the pain, helpless...\"</p><p>\"How well acquainted is he with your whip?\" Than asked, and it was killing Zagreus that they were having an entire conversation without him, while Meg was fucking his face and Than was fucking his ass. Absolutely killing him.</p><p>\"Not as well as he'd like, I'm sure,\" Meg said.</p><p>Zagreus could guess what was in store for him.</p><p>\"Next time, then,\" Than said.</p><p>What was in store for him next time.</p><p>\"What about what I want,\" Zagreus tried to say. His words buzzed against Megaera's clit, and the surprise (after he'd kept his mouth figuratively shut for so long) caused her to gasp sharply, and Zagreus' mouth quickly filled with her come, leaving him choking and gasping.</p><p>Thanatos thrust hard into him, shoving him up along the bed, just as Meg's fingers tightened in his hair, pulling painfully at his skull.</p><p>As if timing it, Thanatos came in Zagreus' ass at the same time, leaving him filled and filthy at both ends, come dripping between his legs and out his mouth. Meg's desperate movements slowed until she rested on him, still, her legs and pussy covering his face. Her fingers still yanked at his hair, and he arched his head back in an attempt to free some of the tension.</p><p>Thanatos pulled hard at Zagreus' cock, no teasing, grip tight and rough. Zagreus whimpered, wanton moans loud despite Meg. His orgasm coursed through him, painfully quick, his body tensing as white as blinding as the surface snow covered the inside of his eyelids in jagged bursts.</p><p>\"Next time we won't be so nice,\" Megaera said, her voice still hoarse. \"We'll just leave you hard and leaking, right here, until you come all by yourself like the desperate slut you are.\"</p><p>\"I have to go, work calls,\" Thanatos said, and <i>was he really talking about work at a time like this when his hand was around Zagreus' cock?</i>, \"so it will have to wait until next time.\"</p><p>Next time. Blood and darkness, Zagreus was already waiting for next time, and Thanatos was still milking Zagreus' orgasm to the point of pain.</p><p>\"Always working, Than, make sure to leave some time for us,\" Megaera said. Finally, she got off Zagreus' face, giving him a glimpse of Thanatos' laughing expression just before he zapped out of existence, cloak and scythe and all.</p><p>\"Hey Meg,\" Zagreus said, not surprised his voice was little more than a croak. \"I don't suppose you could...\" he tugged at the restraints around his wrists. \"I should clean up before I head out again.\"</p><p>Meg laughed, looking down at him. \"Oh no, Zag, it would be a shame if my sisters saw you like this.\"</p><p>\"Oh no. Not Alecto.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Alecto,\" Meg said, mouth curling in a predatory smile. \"Lucky for you she hates your guts already and wouldn't appreciate it.\"</p><p>\"Good to hear,\" Zagreus said, breathing a sigh of relief. \"Also, if this was supposed to be incentive <i>not</i> to call on Than the next time I'm about to kill you...\"</p><p>\"Incentive?\" Meg arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\"Warning?\" Zagreus tried. \"Oh, or maybe an excuse?\"</p><p>\"I guess we'll have to find out next time,\" Meg said, and got off Zagreus' bed.</p><p>Oh no. She wasn't going to just leave him here, was she?</p><p>\"Meg, really, if you could just tell your pink whip here to let me go...\"</p><p>\"Perhaps I'll forget about that until the next time I have work,\" Meg said, almost thoughtfully. \"See you around, Zag.\"</p><p>\"Hey-- Hey! Meg! Than, help!\" Zagreus yanked at the restraints with no results, as Meg walked out the door. \"THANATOS YOUR HAIR LOOKS STUPID SHORT AND IT LOOKED BETTER LONG--\"</p><p>\"I warned you, Zagreus.\"</p><p>\"Death approaches?\"</p><p>Yup.

All during dinner he'd been preparing to fight the PDs for it anyway, thinking of what Hakyeon would've done if he was there. But as he dozes off in the van back to their hotel, lulled by the crackle of Vietnamese over the van driver's radio and the drumming of rain against the metal roof, he has a sudden realization: he and Jaehwan are sharing a room, and for the rest of the evening they'll be together with no other plans. The thought sends a bolt through his nerves, and he curls in on himself to contain his excitement.</p><p>He's practically holding his breath as the six of them say good night in the hallway of the hotel. Over his shoulder, he can hear Jaehwan talking to Wonsik. \"You can come hang out in our room if you want,\" Wonsik says. \"Let Taekwoon get some rest.\"</p><p>\"Nah, it's okay,\" Jaehwan replies. \"I'll take really good care of hyung, I promise.\" And in case his words were too subtle, he nudges the back of Taekwoon's leg with his foot. Taekwoon's hand stutters on the door handle, and he has to unlock the door a second time before it opens.</p><p>The door clicks shut behind them. Jaehwan turns on the light and goes into the room, but Taekwoon pauses for a moment by the door. He needs to ride out the lightness in his chest, and to feel the stillness of the air in a room with just two people in it.</p><p>Slowly, he passes through the hallway created by the closet to the main space. Jaehwan is sitting on the bed he'd claimed earlier, taking off his shoes. His hat is already off and lying on the bedside table; his ashen hair is messy and sticks up a little. After he pulls off his other sneaker, he stops and looks up at Taekwoon. \"What are you looking at?\"</p><p>Taekwoon bites on his smile. He's only a little embarrassed to be caught; there's nothing to hide between the two of them. He goes to the bed and sits down next to Jaehwan. \"You,\" he says, and then he adds, \"You look so cute today.\"</p><p>There's nothing to hide between the two of them, but still, his words sound so cheesy that he drops his head down. He takes off his hat and runs his fingers back through his hair to loosen it up. Then he picks up Jaehwan's hand off the bed and holds it in both of his own, turning it over, running his thumb over the soft fabric of his sleeve. He's been wearing the same sweatshirt for the last week, a white one that's so oversized that the sleeves cover his hands entirely. Only the tips of his fingers peek out from the ends. One of the other members would probably tease him about wearing the same thing for the pre-trip filming and the actual trip, but all Taekwoon can think about is how small he looks in it. \"You wore such a cute shirt.\"</p><p>Jaehwan scrunches up his face. \"It's not cute,\" he says, \"it's swag.\"</p><p>Taekwoon laughs, and he presses a kiss to Jaehwan's fingertips, then down past his sleeve into his open palm. Jaehwan makes a little noise that's somewhere between startled and encouraging. Taekwoon knows by now that Jaehwan feels both just as much. A few months ago, he might have pulled back at the first movement of Taekwoon's head; but now he keeps his hand where it is. When Taekwoon looks up, Jaehwan is watching him with his mouth a little bit open. His irises gleam honey brown in the diffused overhead light.</p><p>Taekwoon puts a hand under Jaehwan's chin, tilting his face upward and making his mouth close in a slight pout. Taekwoon chuckles, biting his lower lip. \"Cute,\" he says again. Then he leans forward, his eyes falling closed, and kisses Jaehwan on his closed lips. He means it to be a short one, but Jaehwan's lips are warm, and even in this foreign country there's a familiar taste to them. Taekwoon lingers a little before leaning back. He feels like he's holding his breath again, and his pulse is heavy in his chest.</p><p>Closer up, Jaehwan's eyes are darker. They glance up and down Taekwoon's face, and then Jaehwan puts his free hand on the back of Taekwoon's head and pulls him back in. His tongue rolls into Taekwoon's mouth, and his fingers grip in Taekwoon's hair and pull a little, making Taekwoon's stomach jolt. Taekwoon tilts his head to get closer, and runs his thumb over the soft fabric of Jaehwan's sleeve.</p><p>Jaehwan wrestles Taekwoon over until his back is against the headboard, and then he gets up from the bed. Taekwoon starts to sit up too, but Jaehwan shakes his head. \"Just a minute,\" he says.</p><p>So Taekwoon stays on the bed as Jaehwan goes into the bathroom. Taekwoon realizes he's still wearing his jean jacket, and he takes it off and lets it drop onto the floor. He closes his eyes, relaxing into the stillness of the room. From the bathroom he can hear the sounds of clothes rustling, water running and hitting the bathtub, Jaehwan muttering to himself. That's all he can hear. In this room it's just the two of them, with more privacy than even their dorm back in Seoul.</p><p>Then the bathroom door opens, and Jaehwan says, \"I'm back.\" A weight sinks into the foot of the bed, and Taekwoon opens his eyes to see Jaehwan there on his hands and knees. He's still wearing the sweatshirt, but with nothing else on underneath: not the button-down shirt he had on before, not his pants or underwear.</p><p>Taekwoon's instantly hard again. His breath shortens as Jaehwan crawls back over his lap on all fours and braces himself with one hand on Taekwoon's shoulder. \"Jaehwan...\" His mouth is too dry to say anything else.</p><p>Jaehwan smirks. \"I look cute, right?\" His voice is harsh and breathy when he speaks low. He leans down to graze Taekwoon's jaw with his teeth and growls like a dog. It's silly, but still, Taekwoon shudders at the base of his spine. \"So cute you wanna bite me?\"</p><p>His shoulder is right there, like he's daring Taekwoon to sink his teeth into it, so Taekwoon does. He bites down hard at first, and Jaehwan jerks with a cry of real pain. It turns Taekwoon on, but it's not the direction he wants to go in right now. Another day, maybe. He lets go and gives a gentler suck to Jaehwan's neck, running his hands slowly up and down Jaehwan's back, until he feels him relax again.</p><p>Jaehwan sits up and reaches down to undo Taekwoon's belt. He unzips the fly of Taekwoon's pants, and Taekwoon gasps when Jaehwan reaches in to rub his whole hand against Taekwoon's erection. The smooth fabric of Jaehwan's sleeve makes an odd friction with Taekwoon's underwear, but through the layers Taekwoon can still feel the outlines of Jaehwan's fingers. He tries to lift his hips a little to press back into Jaehwan's palm. \"Yes,\" he murmurs.</p><p>As Jaehwan works on him, Taekwoon moves his hands up the backs of Jaehwan's smooth thighs. When he gets to his butt he grips it with both hands, enjoying the feeling of his fingers sinking into the flesh. Jaehwan makes a small grunt into Taekwoon's shoulder, and his hand slows down. \"That hurts.\"</p><p>Taekwoon wonders why his desire for Jaehwan is always like this: to hold him too tightly, to bite him, to crush him. \"I can't help it,\" he says, both to Jaehwan and to himself. But he loosens his grip, and with his palms flat against Jaehwan's ass he pulls him in until their hips meet and Jaehwan's straddling him. Taekwoon hikes the big sweatshirt up, exposing Jaehwan's backside up to his slim waist, and even Jaehwan can't resist glancing back over his shoulder to admire it.</p><p>Taekwoon brings his right hand to his mouth and licks the tips of his first two fingers. Then, with his other arm wrapped around Jaehwan's waist, he reaches back down between Jaehwan's ass cheeks and starts moving his fingers against his hole. Jaehwan bucks at the first contact, but Taekwoon keeps his arm firm around Jaehwan's middle. Under his fingers the skin is soft, the pucker of muscle beneath it hard. Taekwoon spits on his fingers again and keeps going. Soon he feels the muscle loosen, and Jaehwan's breathing goes from tight and shallow to freer and louder. His first moan is quiet, surrounded by breaths on either side, and then there are more, building in intensity.</p><p>Outside, the rain continues beating steadily. The sound is warm and enveloping, as if it's not only against the window but all four walls of their room, and their room isn't part of a big hotel but just the space around the two of them, the space around the bed. Jaehwan's open now, and Taekwoon's fingertips start to dip in past the rim. It's just a shallow motion inside, but Jaehwan lets out a broken whine that makes Taekwoon shudder and momentarily shut his eyes.</p><p>\"Oh, it feels good,\" Jaehwan whimpers, half into Taekwoon's shoulder. \"It's so good.\"</p><p>That's all the encouragement Taekwoon needs. He presses his fingers more pointedly into Jaehwan's hole, but his knuckles aren't wet enough to slide in well. With the same hand, he turns Jaehwan's face towards him, and then he puts the fingers he'd been using to Jaehwan's lips.</p><p>Jaehwan keeps his mouth closed and shakes his head. \"It's dirty,\" he whines, his voice still full of air.</p><p>\"It's not dirty,\" Taekwoon says. But to prove it, he puts his fingers in his own mouth instead, making sure Jaehwan's watching as he sucks on them. \"See?\" They taste mostly of his own saliva. He sucks on them one at a time, then both together. It feels good to have something in his mouth, but he forces himself to stop. As good as it feels, there's something better. \"Here.\"</p><p>He puts his fingers against Jaehwan's lower lip again. Jaehwan hesitates, and then he accepts them in his mouth, his eyelids fluttering as he sucks on them slowly. As soon as his eyes return to Taekwoon's, though, his reluctance evaporates. He makes a show of running his tongue along Taekwoon's fingers before sucking them back in, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>Taekwoon watches his fingers going in and out of Jaehwan's pink mouth, and for a second he forgets about anything else. He would be happy with just this, he thinks; he could come just from watching this. It's only when Jaehwan slides his head backward and releases his fingers with a loud pop that he makes himself move on.</p><p>He hooks his chin over Jaehwan's shoulder to get a better look as he guides his spit-slick fingers back to Jaehwan's hole. \"Relax,\" he whispers to Jaehwan, and then he presses his first finger to the entrance. Slowly but steadily, Jaehwan lets him inside. The only sound he makes as Taekwoon moves his finger in and out is breathing through his nose. It's when Taekwoon adds in his middle finger that Jaehwan lets out a short <em>ahh</em>, and then, as Taekwoon moves his fingers, more and more of them, louder and stronger.</p><p>Taekwoon alternates between moving his fingers in and out and keeping them inside while he crooks them back and forth, and Jaehwan's moans grow more and more desperate\u2014more spaced out, but longer and from a deeper place in him. \"Is it good?\" Taekwoon asks. The answer is obvious, but he wants to hear Jaehwan say it.</p><p>Jaehwan doesn't answer with words, though: he takes Taekwoon's left earlobe between his lips and sucks, scrapes the sensitive skin with his teeth and makes Taekwoon shiver all the way down his back. He runs his tongue along the engraved metal of Taekwoon's earring, and Taekwoon can't keep himself from being rough anymore. He plunges his fingers faster in and out of Jaehwan, twisting them inside of him with the full force of his hand, until Jaehwan whines high in his throat.</p><p>\"Taekwoon,\" he gasps. He's panting, breathing at the same rhythm that Taekwoon's fingers are fucking him.</p><p>\"Yes?\"</p><p>\"Can I touch myself?\"</p><p>Taekwoon groans at the question, at the idea that Jaehwan would ask for his permission. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"But don't stop.\"</p><p>Jaehwan wedges his arm between them, and Taekwoon can feel it when he starts jerking himself off: the shuffle of his hand and the long hem of his sweatshirt moving between both their bodies. Taekwoon keeps pace with his fingers in Jaehwan's ass, and presses a kiss to his shoulder that he wants so badly to turn into a bite. Soon Jaehwan's breaths are so loud and close together there isn't even a pause between them.</p><p>\"Don't stop,\" he moans to Taekwoon. \"I'm gonna come, I'm coming. I'm...\"</p><p>He groans and buries his face against Taekwoon's shoulder as his whole body goes still, and Taekwoon stops the movement of his hand, keeping his fingers buried inside Jaehwan's ass as his sphincter spasms around them. The spurts of Jaehwan's come soak into the inside of his sweatshirt, making patches of heat and damp against Taekwoon's stomach.</p><p>Carefully, he works his fingers out of Jaehwan's ass. Jaehwan groans a little when Taekwoon pulls out completely. With the hand he'd used to help Jaehwan to orgasm, still wet from their spit and Jaehwan's insides, Taekwoon reaches in his underwear and starts stroking his own cock with quick, firm movements. Jaehwan hangs off of him, his arms wrapped losely around Taekwoon's neck. His body sits slightly to the side, his naked legs slung over Taekwoon's thighs. Taekwoon closes his eyes, and Jaehwan presses a weak kiss to his face, then to his lips, full and soft.</p><p>\"Do you wanna come on me?\" he whispers. Taekwoon moans, his eyes squeezing tighter and his hand gripping harder, faster. \"I want you to come on me,\" Jaehwan says, and then he lies down beside Taekwoon, urging Taekwoon on top of him with a hand on Taekwoon's hips, pulling at the waistband of Taekwoon's underwear to roll it down.</p><p>His face is still flushed and sweaty and his eyelids are heavy; his sweatshirt is pulled up and messy around his ribs, exposing his soft stomach and his spent cock in a tangle of dark hair. Taekwoon can't last like this, and he doesn't. With just a couple more strokes of his hand, the simmering under his skin boils over and fills his head, and he comes, watching with his mouth open as his semen lands in streaks over Jaehwan's skin.</p><p>He flops down next to Jaehwan, catching his breath. Aside from their shoulders next to each other, they aren't touching, but it still feels like there's a connection between them. The bed is too small for them to be that far apart, anyway. As Taekwoon's breathing slows down, he can hear the rain again, and the song he'd been thinking of earlier comes back into his head: <em>When the rain comes and the music flows, I think of you.</em></p><p>\"Jaehwan-ah,\" he says.</p><p>\"Mm?\"</p><p>Jaehwan turns his head in Taekwoon's direction. Taekwoon had wanted to say something, or maybe just sing to him again. But as he looks at Jaehwan's face, the angles of his cheeks and his nose and the shapes of his lips and eyes, he loses whatever words were in his throat.</p><p>Jaehwan waits, and when nothing happens, he yells, \"Taekwoon-jjing.\" The loudness of his voice breaks whatever spell had been over them, and the two of them both shift on the bed a little bit, each getting more comfortable. Jaehwan doodles with a finger in the mess on his stomach. \"You got my cute shirt dirty,\" he says, with so much gravity that Taekwoon actually feels bad for a moment before he laughs.</p><p>He smears his fingers across Jaehwan's stomach, too, wanting to play. \"I thought it wasn't cute.\"</p><p>\"That's gross,\" Jaehwan shouts. Taekwoon, not caring, wipes his dirty fingers on a dry section of Jaehwan's thigh, then on his own underwear. Jaehwan flops his hands over the bunched-up hem of his shirt above his waist. They're back in his sleeves, completely covered this time. \"It's cute because you said it's cute.\"</p><p>Taekwoon takes the hand closest to him. Jaehwan lets it go passively, letting Taekwoon hold it with both of his hands again. Taekwoon examines it for a moment. Then he presses the sleeve to his lips, as if it's a precious part of Jaehwan. They lie there for a bit longer, listening to the rain, Taekwoon stroking his thumb over Jaehwan's sleeve.</p><p>Finally, Jaehwan pulls his hand away and sits up over the side of the bed. \"I can't take this anymore,\" he squawks, getting to his feet.</p><p>Taekwoon raises his head from the bed in alarm as Jaehwan storms around the room. \"What's the matter?\" he asks.</p><p>Jaehwan snorts. \"I'm just going to wash up,\" he says. \"Relax.\" Taekwoon settles back down on the bed, but a second later Jaehwan leans out of the washroom door. \"Don't go anywhere,\" he says.</p><p>The rain drums against the window. They have the rest of the night together in this room, and more nights to come. Taekwoon smiles, and replies, \"I don't want to go anywhere else.\"</p></div>\n        <!-- end cache -->\n    </div>\n<!--/chapter-->\n\n\n  </div>\n  <!-- END work skin -->\n<!-- END work -->\n\n<!-- BEGIN comment section -->\n<!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.

Music and conversation nagged at the edge of his consciousness despite years of honing his skill at blocking such noises out, refined through years of attending these balls. He\u2019d tucked himself away in a small alcove, one of several scattered about the edges of the hall. The chair was plush and comfortable and there was a second beside it with a table sitting between, the positioning suggesting that this was an area set aside for best conversing about brokered alliances and other politicking that Taekwoon did his best to avoid. Personally, he preferred the Manors and Keeps that had separate rooms for that sort of thing, but like this, he could at least be seen by the Lunenthal elite in their tailored uniforms and fancy gowns, confirming the presence of the heir to the Dragon\u2019s Seat at these blasted things.</p>\n  <p>It was a familiar enough image by now: Taekwoon hidden behind a book, ostensibly present, yet clearly not available for conversation or socialisation. Hongbin had nearly died of laughter when Taekwoon had first picked up the habit\u2014Taekwoon had never been fond of reading as a child. Yet it was the lesser of two evils.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon set his book down on his lap to rub at the corners of his eyes, glancing briefly into the main portion of the hall. He\u2019d been to enough of these balls that they\u2019d all started blurring together. He remembered which Keeps and Manors had the best food and which had the best places to hide, but the grandeur and decor, overstated or not, seemed to all be painted with the same brush. Some stone, some burnished brass, overwhelming arches or fine-painted ceilings. Tonight, it was a simple open room, the Manor displaying its wealth and power through detail and finery, the quality evident in every minute element. They\u2019d opted for the modern look, the doors embossed with the motif of gears, strikingly offset by old stone pillars. There was a large space cleared for dancing, and the young men and women would twirl off in couples, striking in clear cut uniforms, resplendent in richly coloured gowns, a mix of all possible combinations spinning about. But the main draw of these balls was what happened outside of that cleared space: the mingling, the conversations, where rumours were exchanged and lines were drawn. Hongbin was there, somewhere, and Taekwoon felt a surge of affection for his cousin and attendant, who was conversing so Taekwoon wouldn\u2019t have to. Taekwoon thought it all ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t that he <i>couldn\u2019t</i> dance, he\u2019d been brought up well, he just didn\u2019t understand how your ability to step in time with music or guide or be guided by your partner had any bearing on your ability to...well, do anything.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon forced down a grimace, hidden away as he was. A glance at his watch told him there was still a good two hours before he could leave. He reached for his book, hoping it would help him pass the time, but when he made to pick it up, he noticed a shadow hovering at the edge of his vision. Frowning, he looked up.</p>\n  <p>A handsome young man stood in front of him, a smile playing about his lips. He sketched a quick bow before taking the seat beside Taekwoon.</p>\n  <p>\"You don't mind, do you?\" he asked <i>after</i> he'd already sat. \"Unless you're waiting for a young lady companion. Or perhaps a gentleman? You do look like the sort who'd have one.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pressed his lips together. \"I do mind,\" he said. He set his book back down very deliberately, so he could fix the full force of his displeasure on the new comer.</p>\n  <p>\"I revise my opinion\u2014with a look like that, I imagine you'd have difficulty attracting a lady friend, never mind keeping one,\" the man said. Taekwoon worked hard not to scowl. </p>\n  <p>\"I'm reading,\" Taekwoon said flatly.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, but you're not right now,\" the man pointed out.</p>\n  <p>\"You interrupted me,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"You could at least ask my name\u2014it's N, by the way, thank you for asking.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon did scowl at that. He took a deep, steadying breath. \"I didn't ask for a reason,\" he said. \"I'd like it if you left.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I rather like it here,\" the man said. \"A bit quieter. I do enjoy these parties, but it can get a bit loud. It's why you're hiding back here, isn't it?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pursed his lips, and decided there was no reasoning with the man. He picked his book back up, flipping to some random page. He couldn't recall where he was, and in truth, the book was quite dry. One on international trade, Taekwoon vaguely recalled. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t any easier for Taekwoon to absorb himself in the book than it had been a few minutes earlier, and the man beside him did not seem to be deterred. His humming was getting quite distracting.</p>\n  <p>\"Is it interesting?\" the man asked. He made to peer over at Taekwoon's book.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon slammed it shut. \"Please leave,\" he said. He knew that he could, in theory, stand up and leave, but to do so would be to admit defeat\u2014and Taekwoon of the Azure Seat of the Dragon would not be defeated. Besides, how else would Hongbin know where to find him? The man, however, simply met Taekwoon's glare. Taekwoon didn't like that. He could usually drive people away with that glare. It didn't seem to be working.</p>\n  <p>The man, infuriatingly, smiled. \"Is my company really that bad?\" he asked. \"I've been told I'm quite charming.\"</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Taekwoon said simply. He frowned at the man. \"What sort of name is N anyway?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Mine,\" the man answered. He shrugged. Another smile. \"I rather like it.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It\u2019s strange,\" Taekwoon said. Another frown. He never paid attention to people, and he couldn't figure out if the man was part of the upper Twelve Manors or the Twenty Eight Houses. He was quite sure, however, that he wasn't of the Four Cardinal Seats. He was handsome, in his twenties, likely about Taekwoon's age. Tan skin, sharp eyes, and an easy smile that Taekwoon supposed people could find charming. He was quite tall as well, if Taekwoon recalled. Right now, his legs were tucked under the chair as he lounged against the armrest. He was dressed in the same fashion as Taekwoon, unsurprisingly, only where Taekwoon's jacket was one of navy blue, the man wore one that was largely black, and the brooch he wore at his throat was much smaller.</p>\n  <p>\"Hm, is it?\" The man tilted his head, and offered him another infuriating smile. \"It's generally polite to offer your own name as well.\" Taekwoon's cheek twitched.</p>\n  <p>\"Leo,\" he said. He got the sense that the man would not leave him alone. Two hours. He just needed to stay for two more hours. Taekwoon took a deep breath, and turned back to his book.</p>\n  <p>He was faintly\u2014uncomfortably\u2014aware that the man <i>did not leave</i>, but Taekwoon steadfastly kept his eyes on the words this time, ignoring the man's infernal humming. The time crept by painfully slowly. He glanced at his watch every now and then, cursing himself each time as the minute hand crawled about once, and then most of another.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon closed his book and stood.</p>\n  <p>\"Leaving already?\" the man asked.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shot him a sharp look. The man was still lounging in the seat, looking perfectly at ease, legs crossed, hands folded on his lap. Taekwoon didn't bother deigning that with a response. He turned on his heel, tucking his book under his arm. He half expected the man to follow him\u2014he didn't. Spotting Hongbin, Taekwoon made a beeline for him, brushing off attempts to start conversation. He was more than ready to go home.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon watched the young scion of the Azure Seat depart, back ramrod straight and prickling with irritation. He waited until the man had disappeared into the crowds before he himself stood. Unlike Leo\u2019s quick departure, Hakyeon allowed himself to linger, to meander, to smile easily at young ladies and older gentlemen alike, making himself as unnoticeable as possible as he made his way to where their attendants had retreated.</p>\n  <p>\"Ken.\"</p>\n  <p>At his name, a young man with a shock of blond-brown hair snapped about to look. Upon seeing Hakyeon, he sketched a quick bow, and made to follow him out the door. There was a carriage waiting for them which he had his attendant bring around. It wasn\u2019t until they were both sequestered inside, curtains drawn, that Hakyeon allowed himself to let go of his poise and slump gracelessly down on the seat.</p>\n  <p>\"I hate these things,\" he muttered. \"Give me a horse any day.\"</p>\n  <p>\"These are in fashion, young master, and besides, I <i>hate</i> scooping horse poop.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Oh quit the act, Jaehwan,\" Hakyeon said. He shot his 'attendant' an irritated look. Jaehwan laughed, dropping his facade of stiff propriety as well, unbuckling the sword he wore as the sign of his role and tossing it onto the seat next to Hakyeon. He turned about on his seat and pulled open the window-hatch to the driver\u2019s seat. Immediately, a distinctive smoky smell filtered in\u2014Hakyeon\u2019s face molded into one of disgust.</p>\n  <p>\"Hey Wonsikkie, the young master\u2014ow!\u2014says he wants a horse,\" Jaehwan called out, shooting Hakyeon a very wounded look when Hakyeon kicked him in the back.</p>\n  <p>\"Yeah? Tell Hakyeon he can walk if he doesn\u2019t like it,\" came the reply.</p>\n  <p>\"I can hear you,\" Hakyeon said loudly. There was a chuckle from the front, muffled by the constant rumble of the engine and the repetitive clicking of the regulator against the drive gears. The volume had increased as soon as Jaehwan had opened the window. \"Barely, over this racket. How do those people stand these things?\"</p>\n  <p>\"They\u2019re in fashion,\" Jaehwan repeated. \"I distinctly remember you saying that, actually.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t hate them,\" Hakyeon complained. He sighed, tugging off the brooch and unbuttoning his jacket, stowing the brooch away in one of the pockets hidden inside. The Lunenthal elite seemed to find stiff, military uniforms to be fashionable. No wonder Leo was so stuffy, he would be too if he had to wear these damn things day in and day out. \"The sooner this job\u2019s done, the better.\"</p>\n  <p>\"As always,\" Jaehwan said. He shut the hatch, cutting out a good portion of the noise. They\u2019d brief Wonsik when they got back. \"Well? How\u2019d it go?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Kid\u2019s more a stick in the mud than I thought,\" Hakyeon said. He frowned. \"Getting close to him is going to be a challenge.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You talked to him?\" Jaehwan asked. \"I thought this time was supposed to be a look don\u2019t touch.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I got his name, he got mine,\" Hakyeon said. \"I\u2019m going to need all the time I can get.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You told him your name?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p>\n  <p>\"Of course not, what sort of idiot do you think I am? I told him my name\u2019s N.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You haven\u2019t used that one in a while,\" Jaehwan said. His brows drew downwards in thought. \"What was it, that tiny place out east\u2026\"</p>\n  <p>\"Constal,\" Hakyeon answered promptly. \"Wasn\u2019t a big job, and it\u2019s been years. It\u2019s always easier to reuse a name\u2014you know that.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yeah, yeah, you\u2019re great,\" Jaehwan said, scrunching up his nose.</p>\n  <p>\"Of course I am\u2014although if I take any more high profile jobs, I\u2019ll need to work on a new one,\" Hakyeon said. He frowned, already thinking about the difficulty of forming a new name and getting it to stick. Most people didn\u2019t bother\u2014a name to wrap around their true name was enough. And most people <i>couldn\u2019t</i>, as Jaehwan had found. It was an art, a skill, and it was why it was always Hakyeon who was front for these sorts of jobs, even if Jaehwan was just as lethal as Hakyeon, and Wonsik was the best damned shot of all of them.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon sighed again.</p>\n  <p>\"At least we\u2019re getting paid well,\" he said. \"This kid isn\u2019t going to be an easy one.\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"You know, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to actually talk to people every now and then,\" Hongbin said as the carriage neared the place of tonight\u2019s festivities. The Manor of the Cat, if Taekwoon recalled.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon made some sort of noise that he hoped Hongbin would take for the answer he wanted, his arms crossed over his chest. His hair was slicked back today, styled away from his forehead. It served to accentuate the sharpness of his eyes. His mouth was in a near pout, belying the clear look of displeasure.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin sighed, drawing back one of the curtains. He\u2019d tried to get them out of tonight\u2019s mess as he always did, but Taekwoon\u2019s father had insisted. Of course, for if Taekwoon was set to inherit the title, he <i>needed</i> to be seen, to form alliances, to represent the house. If only Taekwoon could give half a damn about it.</p>\n  <p>\"I talk to people,\" Taekwoon said. He stared out the window. They were near. He sighed deeply, clutching at his book of the night as if it could save him. It wouldn\u2019t save him from dinner.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin snorted, shaking his head. \"Yeah, talk to people with <i>words</i>,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>\"I do,\" Taekwoon grumbled. He frowned, recalling the conversation he\u2019d had. \"He didn\u2019t know who I was?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Who?\" Hongbin asked.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged and shook his head. \"I don\u2019t know,\" he said. His frown deepened. \"I didn\u2019t recognise him.\"</p>\n  <p>This drew another laugh from Hongbin. \"Who <i>do</i> you recognise?\" he asked. Taekwoon gave him a dirty look that Hongbin shrugged off. \"Look, I\u2019m just saying you\u2019ll need to at least manage not to offend everyone by not knowing who they are, before you take the title.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know the important people,\" Taekwoon said. \"I won\u2019t offend them.\"</p>\n  <p>\"No, you\u2019ll just offend them in other ways,\" Hongbin said. Taekwoon\u2019s cheek twitched as he crossed his legs. The carriage pulled up to a rattling stop, ending the conversation. Taekwoon tugged at the collar of his jacket, making sure it was straight. Hongbin gave him a small smile of reassurance. For someone who\u2019d been going to these things for well over half a decade, Taekwoon still frankly sucked at it. Hongbin rather thought that his sisters had been too soft on him, allowing him to effectively hide behind them during the first few years, and the Dragon Lord had always had better things to do beyond attending to the social abilities of his youngest child. Hongbin knew that Taekwoon <i>could</i>, if he tried. He conducted himself well in meetings, attended to all the proper etiquette, and was impeccable and regal in his bearing. He just. Wouldn\u2019t. Socialise.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin sighed silently, gone unnoticed by Taekwoon who had stepped out of the carriage first\u2014the petulant young man gone, replaced by the cold-eyed, impassive young lord of the Azure Seat. Honestly, Hongbin hated these things just as much as Taekwoon\u2014but he didn\u2019t have the social status to hide from them.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"You\u2019re here again.\"</p>\n  <p>An irritatingly familiar voice interrupted Taekwoon\u2019s reading on the history of Lunenthal. Taekwoon slowly put down his book, deliberately leaning back in his seat.</p>\n  <p>\"N.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Oh, you do remember me,\" the young man said. Taekwoon\u2019s expression tightened. He\u2019d slipped out onto the balcony this time, and there was only one seat by a small table. For a moment, it looked like the man was going to sit on the table but he leaned back against the railing instead, elbows propped up on it. </p>\n  <p>\"How did you find me?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n  <p>N shrugged, a smile playing about his lips. \"Why would you think I was looking for you?\" he asked. Taekwoon gave him a very flat stare. \"It\u2019s a nice night.\"</p>\n  <p>It was a cloudy night. If anything, it was a bit on the side of chilly for late summer, and Taekwoon wasn\u2019t sure if he believed the man. No, he didn\u2019t believe him at all.</p>\n  <p>\"I\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re looking to find some favour with my father, or to arrange a marriage, you have the wrong person.\"</p>\n  <p>For a split second, there was an odd look of confusion across the man\u2019s face before he burst out into laughter, throwing his head back.</p>\n  <p>\"Oh, oh no, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m neither looking to get married, or to find\u2026favour with your father, whoever he is.\" N pursed his lips. \"I suppose he\u2019s someone important?\"</p>\n  <p>This time, Taekwoon\u2019s expression flashed open incredulity for a good second before he managed to return to one of cool disdain.</p>\n  <p>\"You expect me to believe you?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n  <p>N shrugged, head tilted. \"I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand,\" he said. He smiled a little. \"Although I have to admit that I did choose this particular balcony when I saw you.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon continued to stare at him coldly, but the man didn\u2019t waver. His eyes, however, did drift away from Taekwoon as he hopped up to sit on the railing and twisted about to stare into the murky night. The light from the small lamps on the balcony quickly diffused and disappeared, leaving much of the world to be swallowed by the darkness. There was little to see, even when Taekwoon squinted in that direction.</p>\n  <p>\"It really is a nice night,\" N said, quietly. He did not turn back to Taekwoon as he said this.</p>\n  <p>Suddenly, Taekwoon was struck by the lack of propriety this man seemed to have. His constant interruption, the way he sat perched on the railing, his utter disregard for Taekwoon\u2019s personal space.</p>\n  <p>\"Who are you?\" Taekwoon asked. It was with a genuine note of curiosity.</p>\n  <p>The man turned back to him, offering him an amused smile. \"I thought you\u2019d never ask,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it\u2019s nothing too interesting. I\u2019m visiting from Etoir, although my family is originally of the Crescent House. Lunenthal is quite as magnificent as the stories say.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned at him. \"Is it?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>\"Mmhm.\" N nodded. \"Although I\u2019ve found one gets used to their surroundings, no matter how opulent or dismal they are.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon put down his book, leaning back in his chair. \"You truly don\u2019t know who I am,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Should I?\" N asked.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon thought for a moment, and then shook his head. \"No,\" he said. He blinked at the man.  </p>\n  <p>N shrugged and went back to staring out into the night, where there was nothing. Taekwoon hesitated, almost waiting for some other interruption but none came, and Taekwoon went back to his reading. There wasn\u2019t much to engage him, however\u2014he\u2019d read this particular volume before. He kept peering curiously over the top of his book, but N had yet to move.</p>\n  <p>In the end, it was N who left first, hopping off onto the balcony. He straightened his jacket, brushing it off as he straightened.</p>\n  <p>\"Well, it was nice to chat with you again, Lord Leo,\" N said. A slight smile remained on his face, as he sketched a small bow to Taekwoon. \"I look forward to seeing you again.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shut his book and put it down on his lap.</p>\n  <p>\"How do you know that?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n  <p>N laughed. \"I suppose you must be someone important, which means you\u2019re unlikely to escape from a single one of these\u2014am I right?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pursed his lips, but neither confirmed nor denied. N laughed again, and with a wave, disappeared back into the chaos of the party.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"Remember,\" Hongbin warned, as he stared down at his notes, \"the House of Trials and the Forest House seem to be in the middle of <i>something</i>, and\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Don\u2019t favour either party,\" Taekwoon grumbled. \"I know.\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin snorted entirely improperly as he strode down the hall next to his cousin. \"Right, and don\u2019t forget that\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Father wishes for an alliance with the Silver Seat and I\u2019m to treat the lady of the Manor of the Snake well as she is the daughter of the Tiger Lord. The ambassador from Soliaire will be arriving in a month, and someone from the House of the Lance will be present as they\u2019re married to someone from Soliaire. That Dog brat has been angling for a position in the ministry, but he\u2019s an incompetent fool who\u2019s useless,\" Taekwoon rattled off.</p>\n  <p>\"I wouldn\u2019t say the part about 'incompetent fool',\" Hongbin said, eyes twinkling in amusement, \"but other than that, I have nothing to add.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know what I\u2019m doing,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"I\u2019m sure you do,\" Hongbin said. \"I\u2019d be remiss in my job if I didn\u2019t remind you\u2014so you\u2019ll just have to suffer through this.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And tonight,\" Taekwoon said. It came out near murderous, because he never liked the balls hosted by the Silver Seat of the Tiger. Arrogant louts, the bunch of them. This drew a small laugh from Hongbin that was quickly smothered as they neared the meeting room.</p>\n  <p>\"I\u2019ll find you a nice, boring book,\" Hongbin said, smiling conspiratorially. Taekwoon shot him a flat look, unable to do anything more as Hongbin held the door open for him. <i>I hate you</i>, he hoped his look conveyed, but whether or not it did, Hongbin just sketched a bow as Taekwoon moved to his seat, his face giving nothing away.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>While Hakyeon tried to vary his outfits, it was clear that Leo made no such attempt. Every time Hakyeon had seen him, he\u2019d been wearing the same navy uniform, and the same midnight blue brooch. Not the same, Hakyeon suspected, just several all made in an identical style. It was a finely made uniform\u2014intricate embroidery along the cuffs, details sharp about the shoulders, buttons embossed with exact lines. It fit him, and fit him well.</p>\n  <p>This time, Hakyeon caught sight of Leo over dinner, which Hakyeon rarely chose to attend. The man was seated at the raised table reserved for the hosting family and those of the Cardinal Four, and Hakyeon noted with some amusement that even with his face impassive, his eyes gave away that he was ready to kill. Metaphorically, of course\u2014he was fairly sure the man had never killed a man. He could be wrong, but Hakyeon doubted it. He was simply too soft.</p>\n  <p>Partway through, Hakyeon nearly had to suppress a shudder as those piercing eyes met his across the dining room. In that moment, however, Leo\u2019s eyes shifted into something more akin to curiosity than murder, and a smile flit across Hakyeon\u2019s face at that. But then the moment was over, and Hakyeon sent him a small shrug, before he purposely looked away.</p>\n  <p>He found the man eventually in an alcove on the second floor. He was, as always, ensconced in a book, but Hakyeon suspected he wasn\u2019t truly reading, given that he\u2019d yet to turn the page in the good half hour Hakyeon found himself observing him.</p>\n  <p>Alone, the man seemed much smaller somehow. No, that wasn\u2019t quite the word\u2014less intimidating. He was, without a doubt, bored, given how often he would stare at his watch, or let out a soft sigh. Hakyeon was used to seeing him stiff backed and ramrod straight, but here, he was slouched down, half curled in the seat. He was, Hakyeon realised, quite sure he was alone. Hakyeon couldn\u2019t help the small smile\u2014he was very good at making himself seem like he was not there.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon retreated a good few meters before walking towards the man at a normal pace. At his footsteps, purposely audible, Leo immediately sat up, shutting the book and turning to fix Hakyeon with a steady glare.</p>\n  <p>As always, Hakyeon found himself forcing away the involuntary shiver that his gaze possessed\u2014as much as he hated to admit it, there was something that members of the Cardinal Four possessed that ordinary folks such as himself did not. Perhaps it was their blood, perhaps it was their station, but whatever it was, it always seemed to lend strength to their life force, gave them a presence that seemed more than human. But while Hakyeon may have been affected, N remained calm and easily smiled.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, it\u2019s me,\" Hakyeon said, before Leo could say a word.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon wasn\u2019t sure, but he thought he saw a flicker of amusement pass across the man\u2019s face.</p>\n  <p>\"What do you want?\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>One thing that Hakyeon still couldn\u2019t quite settle was how at odds the man\u2019s voice was with his face and his stature. The first time Hakyeon had spoken to him, it\u2019d caught him by surprise, and it was only with practice that he did not let it show. Given Leo\u2019s height, his broad frame, and severe face, Hakyeon had expected a deep, harsh voice to match. Instead, the man\u2019s voice could nearly be called soft, although dangerously so. As if to say that he could disembowel you without raising his voice in the slightest, without giving way to loud and brash anger, unrefined and crass. An aristocrat, through and through. But right now, the voice was one that was far less hard than Hakyeon had grown used to. If anything, the curiosity that Hakyeon had thought he\u2019d caught during that one glance in dinner was softening it\u2014but that again might\u2019ve been Hakyeon\u2019s imagination.</p>\n  <p>\"Your company,\" Hakyeon said, softly teasing. \"I\u2019ve found I rather enjoy it.\"</p>\n  <p>This drew a quirked eyebrow, far more expression than he\u2019d shown Hakyeon so far. Hakyeon took it as a good sign.</p>\n  <p>\"You are assuming I enjoy yours?\" Leo asked.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, leaning back against a pillar, hands tucked into his pockets as he regarded the young lord.</p>\n  <p>\"I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t assume anything,\" Hakyeon said. \"You are a difficult man to read.\"</p>\n  <p>This time, Hakyeon knew he was not imagining the quick quirk of laughter in Leo\u2019s eyes, matched as it was by the slightest twist of the corner of his lips. It was gone in an instant, the man's expression settling into its usual one of cold passivity. Hakyeon nodded at the empty chair.</p>\n  <p>\"Do you mind?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Leo said, \"but you'll do it anyway.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed at that, even as he lowered himself into the seat. It was not quite as comfortable as its looks advertised, and Hakyeon shifted slightly.</p>\n  <p>\"It's polite to ask,\" Hakyeon said, his eyes twinkling in mirth. There was a small flicker of laughter on the man's face.</p>\n  <p>\"It's impolite to interrupt,\" Leo said flatly, and Hakyeon laughed again. </p>\n  <p>\"I wasn't aware I was interrupting,\" Hakyeon said. \"It seems more to me that I'm rescuing you from your rather dry reading.\"</p>\n  <p>Leo scowled. \"You are interrupting,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"For a good cause,\" Hakyeon said. \"Rescuing you from your boredom, that is.\"</p>\n  <p>The man had his mouth open to retort, but a loud sound, like a gun firing badly, came through the small window behind them. Hakyeon couldn't help the small hitch of surprise.</p>\n  <p>\"Blasted things,\" Hakyeon muttered.</p>\n  <p>Leo glanced at him in amusement. \"The carriage?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Horses are much better creatures,\" Hakyeon said. He missed the way Leo's face immediately molded itself into one of bright interest, as he primly straightened out his suit that didn't need straightening. He didn't, however, miss the genuine note of curiosity in Leo's voice.</p>\n  <p>\"Horses?\" Leo asked. \"You've seen horses?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hm?\" Hakyeon paused, then folded his hands back in his lap as he turned towards the other man. \"Of course. Much more amenable than the carriages here.\"</p>\n  <p>A soft look passed over Leo's face, and only then did Hakyeon notice that all the hostility had disappeared. It was such a startling change that Hakyeon wondered how he hadn't caught it immediately. Hakyeon waited for Leo's reply, but none came, save for a tinge of wistfulness painting itself over his expression. Hakyeon's brows creased in thought, before he understood.</p>\n  <p>\"You've never been outside of Lunenthal,\" Hakyeon said slowly.</p>\n  <p>Leo nodded, several quick nods that didn't at all match his image, as he continued to stare out into the emptiness over the ballroom. Hakyeon's eyes followed his gaze. The Tiger's Keep was a majestic one, even among the Cardinal Four, second only to Leo\u2019s own. At the moment, it was buzzing with activity, but Hakyeon doubted that that was what had caught Leo's attention. He doubted that Leo's attention had been caught by anything visible.</p>\n  <p>For it was true\u2014Lunenthal was not only one of the great city-states, it was arguably the greatest. A majestic, mechanical city, rife with innovation and at the cutting edge of technology. One where creatures such as horses to pull carts, oxes to pull yokes had become obsolete, replaced by great, hulking creations of steel and metal, muscle replaced by gears, hooves by wheels, food by coal, all fueled by the mines that fell within Lunenthal\u2019s lands, strung mostly along its borders. Strong things, not subject to the frailty of life. Life was for begetting life, was how the wisdom went. In other words, such creatures were meant for food.</p>\n  <p>But what caught Hakyeon by surprise was not so much Leo having never having left the bounds of the city of Lunenthal\u2014for even a good three days' carriage or train ride in any direction would still leave you within its mechanical influences\u2014but by the way the words had left his mouth.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon pursed his lips. There was an opportunity here, he knew it. It just depended on how he played it. Glancing at Leo, the man was still silent.</p>\n  <p>\"What do you know about horses?\" Hakyeon asked. He spoke slowly, carefully, as if to a skittish horse he was afraid to spook. </p>\n  <p>Leo seemed to think for a moment, before he shook his head. Hakyeon frowned, unsure of what the man meant, before he shrugged it off.</p>\n  <p>\"I think...\" Leo said slowly, \"I would like them.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Them?\"</p>\n  <p>Leo nodded again, more slowly this time. \"Animals?\" he said softly, questioningly. He laughed\u2014at least, that's what Hakyeon took it for, a soft exhale. \"What are they like?\"</p>\n  <p>This, Hakyeon realised with a jolt, must've been the real Leo. This seemingly smaller, far less intimidating young man. Suddenly, his voice seemed less out of place. </p>\n  <p>\"Nuisances,\" Hakyeon said, lips twitching in amusement. \"That's what my\u2014my attendant calls them. Poop machines.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Are they?\" Leo suddenly seemed a little alarmed at the thought\u2014and then, as if that alarm had triggered some sort of internal warning mechanism, the shutters came back down, and the man in front of him was replaced by the one that Hakyeon had first seen from a distance. Tall, cold, intimidating.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon bowed his head slightly in acquiescence. \"I'm afraid so,\" he said, voice mock grave. The only response he got, however, was an empty silence. Not one that Hakyeon had not been expecting, in truth. </p>\n  <p>And yet, there'd been that flash\u2014</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon's ears picked up footsteps behind them, coming up the stairs. Leo seemed not to have noticed, having gone back to page through his book. It was quiet, distant, and Hakyeon pondered the gamble of being seen with the young lord. There was no harm at this point, he supposed.</p>\n  <p>As the footsteps grew louder, Leo turned to look towards them, a light frown on his face. Hakyeon let himself seem surprised as he too turned to look. A young man strode towards them, hair a rich, deep brown. He was dressed in a similar style to Leo, nearly matching in the cut of his uniform. Handsome, and no doubt headed towards the two of them.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon got smoothly to his feet, sketching a bow to the newcomer.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>The man stopped short, eyebrows pitching upwards in surprise and amusement. \"You've got the wrong man,\" he said. He nodded towards Leo, past Hakyeon, and then bowed deferentially towards him. \"My lord,\" he said, in an almost mockery of Hakyeon's earlier words.</p>\n  <p>\"Why are you here?\" Leo shut the book that he most definitely had not been reading.</p>\n  <p>His attendant, Hakyeon realised, catching sight of the sword belted at his waist. A man of some rank himself. As he would have to be. Likely blood related to the young lord, and as trusted a man as one could have. Hakyeon looked him over as thoroughly as he could without being obvious. He was strong, confident\u2014unsurprising, when one of his duties was as his master's guard\u2014and looked like a man that Hakyeon would not like to cross. Alas, that choice had been taken off the table for him. With luck, he wouldn't have to cross blades with the man. Hakyeon glanced towards Leo. It all depended on how close he could get to the target.</p>\n  <p>\"To fetch you,\" the man said. He gave Hakyeon a strange look that Hakyeon returned with a pleasant smile. He had to tread carefully, here. This one could be dangerous.</p>\n  <p>\"Are we leaving?\" Leo asked. His attendant shook his head, and Leo immediately seemed to droop.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon took it as his cue to depart. \"I will take my leave,\" he said formally, as he bowed. The attendant nodded at Hakyeon, as if dismissing him, while Leo himself merely stared at him.</p>\n  <p>Well. Lunenthal hadn\u2019t been built in a day, and Hakyeon had an idea.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"I have an idea,\" Hakyeon declared.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan stared at him skeptically as they got out of the carriage. In front, Wonsik was locking it down\u2014he too had an expression that spelled less than full trust as he joined them, suspicion clear even in the darkness of night. Hakyeon wrinkled his nose at their faces.</p>\n  <p>\"And...what's your idea?\" Wonsik asked slowly.</p>\n  <p>\"We,\" Hakyeon said, pausing for effect, \"are getting a cat.\"</p>\n  <p>\"We're <i>what</i>?\" Jaehwan all but squawked. </p>\n  <p>\"You've cracked,\" Wonsik said flatly. \"A cat. A <i>cat</i>.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon frowned, stalking past the two of them. \"It'll work, I know it will. He's curious. He's never been outside of Lunenthal, never seen an animal.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yeah, because animals are for food,\" Wonsik pointed out. He jogged to catch up, Jaehwan following.</p>\n  <p>\"No, no, not always,\" Jaehwan said. Like Hakyeon, Jaehwan had been raised far from the city of Lunenthal, where attitudes towards living creatures tended to be different, even beyond the mules and oxes that served steady, practical purposes. \"You're talking about the job? You think a cat will help?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded firmly. He couldn't quite explain, but the way the man's face seemed to have lit up, come to life\u2014he knew it would. Someone like Leo would be impossible to kill without getting him to truly let his guard down, without him trusting Hakyeon to some degree. If they knew his true name, it would give Hakyeon a deeper hold on him, but that was about as likely as Hakyeon taking the Seat of the Dragon for himself. As for the cat\u2026 There was also the question of logistics, but he'd worry about that after.</p>\n  <p>\"Well, you are the one in the best position to judge,\" Wonsik said. He frowned as he matched Hakyeon's steps up towards the house. \"We've never talked to him.\"</p>\n  <p>\"A real stuck-up grouch,\" Jaehwan said. When they both shot strange looks at him, he shrugged. \"The attendants talk\u2014what, do you think they just sit there mute while their lords and ladies gallivant off to have fun? Besides, you don't need to talk to the man to see him.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It'll work,\" Hakyeon said again.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan sighed. \"Hyukkie is not going to be pleased,\" he said, nodding towards the house. </p>\n  <p>\"Wait. I have a question.\" Wonsik suddenly stopped short, the other two turning to glance at him. \"Who...is going to get this...cat?\"</p>\n  <p>He was greeted by two pairs of innocently blinking eyes. \"No. Oh no, I am not\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Don't be silly, I certainly can't leave here, and it'd be strange if Ken disappeared if I were still here,\" Hakyeon said, voice pleasant. There was definitely a strain of amusement there too, that Wonsik wasn't sure if he appreciated.</p>\n  <p>\"Can I at least take the carriage?\" Wonsik asked, already dreading the train ride and subsequent journey by horse or cart.</p>\n  <p>\"You know the answer to that.\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon grunted, blocking Hongbin's slash. He danced to the side but Hongbin was faster and before Taekwoon had a chance to react, he was on his back, Hongbin's blade at his throat.</p>\n  <p>\"Five - naught,\" Hongbin said. His cousin's face was gleeful as he let Taekwoon up.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon, however, did not get up, opting instead to flop back down after an aborted attempt. It threw up a plume of dust and Taekwoon winced as some of it got into his eyes.</p>\n  <p>The afternoon sun was more than just warm, and Taekwoon's shirt stuck damply to his skin with sweat. His bangs were plastered against his face as well, and he was more than ready to call it a day. The truth was, losing five times in a row had soured his mood. It would sour anyone's mood.</p>\n  <p>\"I only lose to you,\" Taekwoon grumbled. </p>\n  <p>\"Until you stop losing to me, you're going to continue training,\" Hongbin said. He prodded at Taekwoon's prone form with his foot, which was swatted away half-heartedly. Taekwoon sat up slowly with a groan. </p>\n  <p>\"I can more than protect myself,\" Taekwoon said. He wiped the sweat off from his face, before retrieving his sword from where he'd dropped it when Hongbin had knocked him down.</p>\n  <p>\"Until the day you can't,\" Hongbin said. </p>\n  <p>\"Don\u2019t feel too bad\u2014our Binnie hasn\u2019t been bested by anyone lately.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon turned towards the newcomers\u2014Hongbin\u2019s friend, Gongchan, as well as his lord. Taekwoon squinted a little as he tried to place his name, but while he was used to Gongchan dropping by unannounced, he hadn\u2019t met Gongchan\u2019s lord as often. He settled for just shifting his blade in his hand, watching the exchange.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin flushed a little but laughed it off, clasping Gongchan's arm as he neared. He sketched a bow to Gongchan's lord but it was clear that there was still enough familiarity there that it was a mere formality, perhaps for Taekwoon's sake. Taekwoon stared at him. He looked the friendly sort, kind of stupid, extremely soft. Not a threat, Taekwoon quickly categorised him as. He was probably well ranked, or enough so that he would have an attendant as ranked as Gongchan, but Taekwoon couldn't remember having ever heard of him outside of that context. He glanced at Hongbin who caught his eye, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. Taekwoon frowned lightly in annoyance.</p>\n  <p>\"Lord Sandeul,\" Hongbin finally said, taking pity on him. \"You've met before.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Channie tells me a lot about you,\" Gongchan's lord said. When he smiled, his eyes curled into crescents. Taekwoon shot Gongchan\u2014who shrugged\u2014and then Hongbin\u2014who grinned\u2014sequential hard looks. He suspected that very few of the things that Sandeul had heard were good things.</p>\n  <p>\"Hongbin,\" Taekwoon said softly.</p>\n  <p>\"We didn't mean to interrupt,\" Gongchan said. He stepped back, nodding at Taekwoon. Hongbin, however, shook his head.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not interrupting anything,\" Hongbin said. He glanced at Taekwoon, grinning. \"You probably saved him getting his ass kicked a sixth time though.\"</p>\n  <p>It was only through a forced sense of propriety, the presence of witnesses, and the knowledge that retaliation would involve forementioned ass kicking for the sixth time, in front of said witnesses, that kept him from lunging at Hongbin. He settled for glaring at him in extreme displeasure, which just made Hongbin laugh. Blast him.</p>\n  <p>\"Also,\" Hongbin added, \"don't pretend that you care about interrupting.\" Gongchan laughed loudly at that, completely unabashed at having been caught. Taekwoon had suspected as much. Sandeul, however, looked a little embarrassed. But that could have been Taekwoon's projection.</p>\n  <p>\"We're just passing by,\" Sandeul said.</p>\n  <p>\"I wanted to play with Hongbin though,\" Gongchan said. Taekwoon could've sworn that those were puppy eyes that he was turning on his lord.</p>\n  <p>\"I need you to arrange a meeting,\" Taekwoon said, turning to Hongbin and opting to ignore the interlopers.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin squinted at him. \"A what?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged, as nonchalantly as possible. \"I received a message,\" he said. \"From N. He said he had a surprise. I'm curious.\"</p>\n  <p>His words were less polished than he would've liked, and he grimaced internally. From the look on Hongbin's face, Taekwoon wasn't the only one who\u2019d been caught a little wrongfooted. </p>\n  <p>\"A meeting. A surprise.\" Hongbin frowned as he took in Taekwoon's words.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon nodded. \"That's what he said.\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin pursed his lips. \"He didn't happen to say what kind of surprise, did he?\"</p>\n  <p>\"A secret?\" Taekwoon said after a long moment. He frowned. It had been a short message, strangely enough, delivered personally by N's attendant. He'd been a fairly tall man as well, sandy blond hair and a rather memorable nose. Well dressed, solid enough sword, impeccably clean white gloves. He also hadn't given up much more information when pressed, only to reiterate that it was a 'surprise'. Part of Taekwoon wished that Hongbin had been around to receive it\u2014the other part was secretly glad that he'd gotten to know of this first hand. \"I want to know what it is he has to show me,\" Taekwoon added.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin nodded. He had his misgivings, beginning and ending with \"surprise\" and possibly encompassing N. Yet, it was rare that Taekwoon took interest in anything outside of his usual loves, and Hongbin would have felt like a real asshole to say no. Technically, Taekwoon could just ignore whatever Hongbin said, but Hongbin knew that in this case, he likely would have just let it go.</p>\n  <p>\"You want him to come here?\" Hongbin asked, expecting Taekwoon's answer\u2014the shake of Taekwoon's head surprised him.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't want...\" Taekwoon trailed off, suddenly strangely soft, as he glanced back at the Keep.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin frowned at him, but Taekwoon didn't elaborate. If anything, he seemed to close up, but not in the way that emanated coldness, but in the way that made him seem extremely small. Hongbin was suddenly uncomfortably aware of his friends' presence and their silence. He didn't want his father to know, Hongbin abruptly puzzled out. He blinked.</p>\n  <p>\"I'll arrange something,\" Hongbin said. Taekwoon seemed to be stifling a smile as he nodded.</p>\n  <p>\"Then I'll leave you be,\" Taekwoon said. He nodded at Hongbin's friends and went to sheathe his sword, before turning to walk away. Hopefully there was something around in the kitchens.</p>\n  <p>He definitely, absolutely was not looking forward just a little bit to this 'surprise'.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>The thing was black, and small, and with large eyes set in a round face and it was so <i>small</i>. Taekwoon tentatively reached out towards it\u2014it made a strange noise, and Taekwoon yanked his hand back. He glanced up at N, but he only gave him a small one shouldered shrug. It was so small. This time, Taekwoon brushed his hand against the thing's body, before the thing seemed to jump a little.</p>\n  <p>\"It\u2019s so soft,\" Taekwoon said. \"And warm.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It\u2019s a cat,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>\"Cat.\" Taekwoon frowned down at the creature. \"But that\u2019s a Manor?\"</p>\n  <p>\"I imagine the Manor was named after the animal,\" N said. \"As are the others. Not the other way around.\"</p>\n  <p>\"They\u2019re just a symbol,\" Taekwoon said. The thing\u2014the cat\u2014was staring up at him with its round eyes. They seemed to shift between gold and green, but its pupils were solid black, sharp and diamond shaped. Its tail was swishing back and forth, and Taekwoon briefly thought about grabbing it. It had been so soft\u2014this time, Taekwoon reached out a little more boldly. Too boldly, perhaps, because there was a sudden flash of pain as it raked its nails down Taekwoon\u2019s hand before leaping off the table.</p>\n  <p>\"Blast\u2014are you, I\u2019m so\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Tae\u2014you\u2019re bleeding!\"</p>\n  <p>\"It doesn\u2019t hurt,\" Taekwoon murmured. He\u2019d scared it, and it was looking at him warily now. Both Hongbin and N had surged forward but Taekwoon ignored them and their commotion. Instead, he dropped all propriety as he crouched down on the floor, approaching it slowly this time. Its tail was held high, puffed and bristling, and its fear was almost palpable, ears flattened back against its head. Taekwoon was much bigger than it.</p>\n  <p>\"I\u2019m not going to hurt you,\" he said quietly. He sat down, but even so, he must have been too big to the cat. Awkwardly, Taekwoon lay down on his stomach, ignoring Hongbin\u2019s sudden cough, until he was at eye level with the cat. Taekwoon held very still as the cat leaned forward, and then took one careful step and then another, nose twitching in what Taekwoon guessed was curiosity. Its eyes were fixed on him and it was a little unnerving, having such a sharp gaze focussed on him like that. Slowly, eyes not leaving Taekwoon, it nudged closer, and closer, and Taekwoon couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little because it tickled when it bumped against his face. It was so soft. Unthinkingly, Taekwoon\u2019s eyes curled half closed as his face broke out into a grin and he laughed as the cat rubbed its head against the side of Taekwoon\u2019s face.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon looked up at the others. \"It\u2019s so soft,\" he said, voice filled with delight. This time, when he held out his hand, the cat pushed its head under it, and Taekwoon cautiously rubbed his fingers against its head. It made that same sound again, a low, rumbling sound. He glanced up at N, a little in alarm.</p>\n  <p>\"It likes it,\" N said, correctly interpreting his question. The other man crouched down next to Taekwoon and the cat, but the cat ignored him, opting instead to continue bumping its head against Taekwoon\u2019s hand.</p>\n  <p>\"It does?\" Taekwoon tried rubbing it a little harder, and the sound got louder, and yes, it did seem happy. Or at least, not angry or frightened. Taekwoon smiled, running his hand down the creature\u2019s head and along its back. It was so warm, and he could feel the rumbling as he did it again and again.</p>\n  <p>\"I thought you\u2019d be interested.\" N\u2019s voice tugged Taekwoon back towards reality, enough for him to nod in answer.</p>\n  <p>\"Can we keep it?\" Taekwoon asked suddenly. He looked up at Hongbin, with all the pleading in his eyes of a five year old asking for sweets.</p>\n  <p>\"Are you daft?\" Hongbin said before he could help himself. \"Where are you going to keep it? How are you going to explain where it came from\u2014where did you even get this thing?\" The last was directed towards N. Hongbin\u2019s voice was barely toeing the boundary of respect, and there was a hint of suspicion in there that Taekwoon, had Taekwoon even been listening, would have missed regardless. Whether or not it was lost on N was shrugged off in the same motion with an easy smile.</p>\n  <p>\"Oh, I\u2019m afraid Etoir lags behind Lunenthal in the times,\" N explained. \"Lord Leo\u2014well, I thought he might find it interesting, so I had someone fetch it.\"</p>\n  <p>N\u2019s attendant abruptly coughed, one of those coughs that were clearly an awkward cover of laughter. Hongbin looked at him sharply, but Taekwoon still had eyes only for the creature.</p>\n  <p>\"I say,\" the man said, stepping conspiratorially close to Hongbin, \"don\u2019t you feel like a chaperone right now?\"</p>\n  <p>\"What.\" Hongbin stared him down blankly.</p>\n  <p>The man grinned at him openly. \"Like we're chaperoning a playdate between two adorable children,\" he said, voice a mock whisper so as to not let his lord hear. It clearly did no good as N shot him a withering look.</p>\n  <p>By the time Ken had managed to drag Hongbin out of the room, Taekwoon had sat up, the cat settled on his lap, head nestled against Taekwoon\u2019s leg.</p>\n  <p>\"You thought I would find it interesting?\" Taekwoon asked softly. He glanced up at N who replied with an affable smile as he too sat down on the ground. </p>\n  <p>\"Do you not?\" N asked. His voice was almost smug, and Taekwoon twitched a little at that. </p>\n  <p>Abruptly, he realised that he was sitting on the <i>floor</i> with a stranger, a strange creature in his lap, and that moments earlier he had been lying on the floor. Taekwoon stiffened, although his hand still rested gently on the creature's head.</p>\n  <p>\"I do,\" Taekwoon said simply. The cat was still making that low rumble, a purring sound, and it vibrated against Taekwoon. It was a nice feeling, and Taekwoon continued to stroke his fingers through its soft fur.</p>\n  <p>\"I'm glad,\" N said. \"I did have to go to a little trouble.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon narrowed his eyes slightly. \"Why?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>N shrugged, expression still light. \"You find it interesting, do you not?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>\"I find that people tend to want things in return,\" Taekwoon said. </p>\n  <p>\"Seeing your interest is enough,\" N said. He shrugged, then reached out to pet the creature as well. Taekwoon stiffened as his arm drew close, but it was the cat who snapped at the other man\u2014Taekwoon couldn't help the laugh. \"Ungrateful creature,\" N muttered.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pursed his lips. He stared at N hard, but the man gave away nothing in his expression. \"How did you know where I lived?\" he asked. \"I thought you didn't know who I was.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It wasn't difficult to find out who you were,\" N said. \"You were seated at the Cardinal table, and from there, it was simply a question of finding out who the grumpy one was.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And that has nothing to do with...this cat,\" Taekwoon said. He ignored N's description of him as the 'grumpy one'\u2014he wasn't the first to have provided that description, and Taekwoon wouldn't lower himself to take the bait.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" N said simply. He let his lips part in a small smile. \"What could I ask of you, anyway?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Favour. Deals. Alliances.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I'm merely visiting from Etoir,\" N said. His voice fell into a pedantic tone, a plain litany of things. \"Although I belong to the Crescent House, my relations are weak, as we are but a branch, and only truly of the house in title. Any favour or alliance I may form with you would be useless to them, and myself as well, for I am, again, merely a visitor. Your father is influential as I am sure you shall be as well, but will your influence truly extend across countries to someone as unimportant as I?\" N paused, and then smiled again. \"Will you believe me now?\"</p>\n  <p>The man's logic was sound, Taekwoon had to give him that. And yet, regardless of his reason, it was true that Taekwoon felt he wasn't here to <i>want</i> something. The man had approached him, had not known who he was, and had not asked for favours, not had he acted like Taekwoon was used to people acting\u2014full of praise and deference and too well polished words. No, this man was one who seemed to care naught for what Taekwoon wished or thought\u2014of himself or otherwise\u2014and cared even less not to offend Taekwoon. He was strange, different\u2014strangely enough, Taekwoon was slowly coming to the realisation that he didn't mind.</p>\n  <p>Instead, he looked down at the cat.</p>\n  <p>\"It's so small,\" he said, and then paused. \"'Life is to beget life, for life is fragile.'\"</p>\n  <p>\"But 'the fragility of life is what makes it worthwhile and treasured',\" N said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon looked up at him sharply in surprise.</p>\n  <p>\"I admit I did approach you with reason,\" N said. \"What sort of man would come to a party only to read?\"</p>\n  <p>\"You like reading,\" Taekwoon said slowly.</p>\n  <p>\"Do you not find ideas fascinating?\" N asked.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged, perhaps not knowing the answer himself. The cat shifted in his lap, drawing his attention back downwards. </p>\n  <p>\"Yet we say that this is worthless,\" Taekwoon murmured. </p>\n  <p>\"It has no value,\" N said. \"It is too small to be eaten\u2014life to beget life. And it is true that the frailty of life deems such things worthless.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You don't believe what you just said,\" Taekwoon said. \"About that making life worthwhile and treasured. You believe it applies only to humans.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Isn't that what the words were written to mean?\" N said, and Taekwoon knew that he was right. Until this moment, he had never given it much thought. Until this moment, he had not realised that animals were <i>real</i>. Of course, those such as pigs, chickens, rabbits\u2014the must have been real on some level for them to provide meat, but even now, he did not know what they might appear to be.</p>\n  <p>\"Value is given by humans,\" Taekwoon said. He looked down at the creature on his lap. He could not explain what worth, what value, yet he instinctively felt that there must have been something.</p>\n  <p>\"Yet different humans have different value,\" N said softly. There was something strangely hard in his voice, but it went nearly missed by Taekwoon, if not altogether so.</p>\n  <p>\"What do you mean?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n  <p>\"You send your machines against human men,\" N said. \"You march them along the borders, and you destroy human lives while losing few of your own soldiers. You value the lives of your own men greater than those of the enemy.\"</p>\n  <p>\"If I didn't, I'd be a poor commander,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>N spread his hands in a placating gesture. \"Of course\u2014I'm merely saying that the value differs. An example.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pressed his lips into a thin line. \"You think I do not value human lives,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"I know very little of what you think,\" N said, his voice suddenly playful. \"Other than that you don't seem to like me very much.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon stifled a small laugh. \"There are very few people I like,\" he said plainly. \"Don't think you're special.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I can't say I'm surprised,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>And yet, Taekwoon could not truthfully say that he disliked the man. He scratched idly behind the cat's ears, drawing a particularly loud purr. Its heartbeat was strong, seemingly stronger than the creature itself. Taekwoon looked down at it, at how he could wrap its entire head in his hand. He suspected that were he to really try, he could have crushed that small head. Four small scratches on his hand still bled sluggishly.</p>\n  <p>\"Does it truly not hurt?\" N asked. He gestured at Taekwoon's hand.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged. \"Not enough to matter,\" he said. \"And it was scared. I scared it. Anyone scared will strike out. Only it went about it more plainly than most.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Than most?\" N asked.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon's lips twitched. \"Humans rarely attack so straightforwardly,\" Taekwoon said. </p>\n  <p>\"You sound like you speak from experience,\" N said. </p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged again. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"Or perhaps it's only an observation.\"</p>\n  <p>\"An observation: you're much friendlier outside of the parties,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>\"This is a meeting,\" Taekwoon said. \"You usually interrupt.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And yet you agreed to this meeting,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>\"I was curious,\" Taekwoon said. Curious of the surprise, and curious of the man himself\u2014a brief thought, a stray one, that Taekwoon barely caught as it slipped through his mind. </p>\n  <p>\"And your curiosity has been satisfied?\" N asked. Taekwoon inclined his head. </p>\n  <p>\"I would like to keep it,\" Taekwoon murmured, \"but I suppose it is yours.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I'm afraid so,\" N said. He inclined his head as well, although the meaning was different, and a smile played on his lips. \"Your attendant did not seem to find it a good idea either.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose,\" Taekwoon said. \"I wouldn't know how to keep it alive.\"</p>\n  <p>\"'Life begets life',\" N said. \"It is the same for all creatures, this one included.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon looked down at it, at its small head resting against his lap, feeling its small heart beating strongly beneath his palm. \"I like it,\" he said. \"Its existence is a good thing.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Then you differ from your countrymen,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps,\" Taekwoon said. \"But is that such a bad thing?</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Four pairs of eyes stared down at the cat as it stalked down the hall as if it owned the place.</p>\n  <p>\"So...it stays here.\" Sanghyuk stared at the three of them, clearly not entirely pleased.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon shrugged. \"I don't see why not,\" he said. \"Wonsik did go to all the trouble of fetching it after all.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It better have been worth it,\" Wonsik grumbled.</p>\n  <p>\"Oh, I don't think you have to worry about that,\" Hakyeon murmured softly. He could still remember the smile that had softened the young lord's face as he'd looked down at the creature. Hakyeon felt a pang of something in his chest, perhaps one of genuine guilt that he was to end that smile. But then again, he had ended the lives of far better men than this one.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan's eyes flickered towards Hakyeon, but it was a gesture that Hakyeon missed.</p>\n  <p>\"It's too small to eat,\" Sanghyuk said speculatively. Wonsik coughed.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, yes, I know, that's what you said,\" Hakyeon said. \"No, I don't think eating it would be a good idea. I don't wonder if Leo won't want to see it again.\"</p>\n  <p>\"That stick in the mud?\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon looked at him sharply. \"You saw him,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"True,\" Jaehwan said, shrugging. \"Strange man. Lying down on the floor like that for an animal.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Does it matter?\" Hakyeon asked. He sighed deeply. \"Jaehwan, take care of it. It can stay outside.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hey, this is <i>my</i> house,\" Sanghyuk said.</p>\n  <p>\"Don't worry, your cut will more than compensate,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Why am <i>I</i> taking care of it,\" Jaehwan whined. \"You can't just order me around like that.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Well, I'm not, and Wonsik went to fetch it, so you're the only one left,\" Hakyeon said, as if it were obvious.</p>\n  <p>\"Who died and made you leader,\" Jaehwan grumbled, to both Wonsik and Sanghyuk's laughter.</p>\n  <p>\"Pretty sure he was leader from the start,\" Wonsik said. He clapped Jaehwan on the shoulder. \"Have fun, and don't pick it up. Thing scratches like the devil.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan sighed, staring down the hall as it disappeared around the corner. \"Do you really think this will work?\" he murmured.</p>\n  <p>\"I hope it will,\" Wonsik said. A hard tone wound abruptly through his words, one that matched the look in his eyes. \"It's always worked among the lesser Houses. Keeps them too busy to aim for them, if they\u2019re fighting among themselves.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Mmm.\" Jaehwan glanced at Wonsik, but did not comment. He did, however, frown and turn to Hakyeon, brows drawn together deep in thought. \"Right, so, uh, what happens after we kill the guy again?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Trust Jaehwan to forget.</p>\n  <p>\"The Cardinal Four get a taste of their own medicine, and Soliaire can finally\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"No, I meant, what happens <i>right away</i>,\" Jaehwan said. He glowered a little at Hakyeon, who just shrugged.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, it\u2019s not too difficult to think through,\" Hakyeon said, his tone suggesting things about Jaehwan\u2019s intellect that Jaehwan was less than pleased about. \"The only remaining heir to the Azure Seat is killed\u2014now who could\u2019ve wanted him dead? Go on, I\u2019m sure you can figure this one out.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Onyx,\" Wonsik said, quickly cutting in before Jaehwan could throttle Hakyeon. \"They have the most to gain. But that\u2019s too obvious\u2014so perhaps it\u2019ll be the Silver Seat.\"</p>\n  <p>\"What\u2019s wrong with the other one?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n  <p>\"Idiot. Two of his sisters are married into that family,\" Hakyeon said. \"It\u2019s why the target\u2019s the only one left. All three of the older offspring decided it was too bothersome. Strange\u2014those born to power shirking it, while those born to less strive to gain.\"</p>\n  <p>The three of them fell silent momentarily, while Sanghyuk continued leaning against the wall, watching them with some interest, a hint of curiosity, yet with no investment whatsoever. Wonsik seemed to have sunk into himself, sparks of anger he usually kept so well hidden skipping off his skin.</p>\n  <p>\"Taste of their own medicine indeed,\" he finally said. \"Let them feel what it\u2019s like, have one of the Manors take one of the Seats.\"</p>\n  <p>\"What?\" Jaehwan blinked. \"That\u2019s possible?\"</p>\n  <p>\"It\u2019s not unprecedented,\" Hakyeon said. \"It\u2019s only happened once, but.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Tigers slaughtered by pigs,\" Wonsik muttered. \"Serves them right.\"</p>\n  <p>There would be no love lost when Soliaire finally struck out at Lunenthal, with their government weakened by the infighting. Hakyeon glanced at Jaehwan, scarred hands and missing finger hidden under gloves, the way he shied from places too small and dark, or how he would still unconsciously shrink within himself, too used to making himself small enough to fit into the smallest spaces of the coal mines. He looked at Wonsik, who\u2019d lost too much family in one of those vicious bids for power that the highest government would never explicitly endorse, yet would always quietly encourage. It was true that the job paid well, but there was something far more personal there.</p>\n  <p>As for Sanghyuk, Crescent House as he was, with his clean hands and his clear eyes, he was so far removed from it all that even if the Azure Seat thought to investigate N, it was unlikely that Sanghyuk would fall under any suspicion. It was all very neatly done.</p>\n  <p>Of course, because Hakyeon was <i>good</i>. All three of them were good.</p>\n  <p>\"The next ball is in a week,\" Hakyeon said, pulling himself out of his thoughts.</p>\n  <p>\"Right,\" Wonsik said, straightening his shoulders, the tendrils of hatred slipping away. \"Hosted by the Manor of the Wolf. The target is likely to attend, as usual, and since Crescent also falls under the banner of the Tiger, it would make good sense for you to attend as well.\" He frowned. \"That ambassador is supposed to arrive the week after that. There's some relations to the Lance, so it's likely one of the Manors under the Dragon banner will host some sort of party. The current rumours say that it will be the Manor of the Snake, but it really comes down to who announces it first. I wouldn't advise attending that one, or if you do, avoid the ambassador. He's unaware, and it should remain that way.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan whistled. \"Thorough,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, well someone has to be,\" Wonsik said, squinting at Jaehwan. Jaehwan just shrugged and laughed. </p>\n  <p>\"Sounds complicated,\" Sanghyuk said. \"I don't see why you can't stab the man and be done with it.\"</p>\n  <p>\"He won't go down so easily,\" Hakyeon said. \"I met his attendant as well\u2014I haven't seen him fight, but I can tell he's good. The target seems soft, but I have no doubt he can defend himself. It'll already be difficult without knowing his true name, and I don't think we'll manage to find it. Short of decapitating him, it won't be possible to kill him without getting close to him first, get him to let his guard down\u2014his life force is too strong. He's still too suspicious of me, but I don't doubt we'll manage before the deadline.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Three months left,\" Jaehwan pointed out. </p>\n  <p>\"I'll admit I had my doubts,\" Hakyeon said slowly, the words themselves reluctant to follow, \"but after today, I'm sure it'll go well.\"</p>\n  <p>Yet, there was some faint spark of reluctance that Hakyeon was not used to feeling, but rarely were his targets so young\u2014rarely had he seen such radiant, open smiles that would be a shame to end. He'd killed better men, better women, it was true\u2014something so superficial ought not to have mattered.</p>\n  <p>\"Speaking of today, you're right about his attendant,\" Jaehwan said, and then paused. \"He's suspicious of you\u2014it might be harder to get him to let his guard down than the target, at this point.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It's his job to be suspicious,\" Hakyeon said. \"Anyway, I don't need to kill the man to kill the target.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I could always try,\" Wonsik said. He shrugged. \"The new gun has a fairly long range.\"</p>\n  <p>\"No, I doubt it'll work,\" Jaehwan said, frowning. \"Same reason as the target. Life force is too strong. You won't manage without knowing his name. Between the two of us, we might be able to incapacitate him, but he'd likely live. Decapitation is <i>messy</i>\u2014I\u2019d really rather not.\" Jaehwan made a face at the thought.</p>\n  <p>Sanghyuk sighed dramatically.</p>\n  <p>\"Right, well, you three talk about your murder plans, I'm going to play cards with Jae, any of you in?\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon squinted across the room at what he swore was a familiar figure. Except, he was fairly sure that Sandeul was not here, because he\u2019d made a note to himself that maybe speaking to him at this thing would be one way to get people off his back about socialising.</p>\n  <p>\"Isn\u2019t that\u2026\" Taekwoon nudged Hongbin, nodding towards a small cluster of people, which included the Wolf Lord, if he wasn\u2019t seeing things. Hongbin looked, and furrowed his brows at Taekwoon.</p>\n  <p>\"What?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>\"Your friend,\" Taekwoon said plainly.</p>\n  <p>\"Gongchan?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon nodded. \"What\u2019s he doing here?\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \"This is his Manor,\" Hongbin said. \"Why shouldn't he be here?\"</p>\n  <p>\"It\u2019s his\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"You didn\u2019t know?\" Hongbin frowned at him. \"He would\u2019ve been heir to the title if he hadn\u2019t turned it down to become Sandeul\u2019s attendant. He usually doesn't attend these things, since Sandeul isn't obligated to as he isn't the heir, but I suppose his family persuaded him for once.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned in confusion as he glanced again across the room, where Gongchan was smiling politely, holding himself with all the decor that Taekwoon was not used to seeing in him. He\u2019d known that Gongchan was either from one of the Manors or had been the heir to one of the Houses or something like that, but heir to the title of the Wolf Manor was far more than Taekwoon had expected.</p>\n  <p>\"But\u2026\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, Sandeul is only second in line for the title, and <i>yes</i> the Manor of the Monkey is far less powerful than the Wolf.\" Hongbin said this with the air of someone who\u2019d heard this argument too many times. He likely had, Taekwoon thought.</p>\n  <p>\"How did I not know?\" Taekwoon murmured.</p>\n  <p>\"It was a long time ago,\" Hongbin said. He shrugged. \"Gongchan's younger brother is now heir to the title. Like you, he doesn't have a choice.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said, frowning as he thought. \"I've met him. He seemed like a good youth.\"</p>\n  <p>They were standing at the fringe of the mingling, yet still hidden in an alcove, and Taekwoon knew that he would have to make a quick circle through the people before long. He was dreading it, as always. He glanced at the book in Hongbin's hand, but it was custom that Hongbin wouldn't relinquish it to him until he'd met with at least three separate people. Taekwoon pursed his lips, schooling his face into one of cold passivity, the one he always wore at these things.</p>\n  <p>\"Fancy seeing you here.\" A now familiar voice came from behind him, and Taekwoon turned in some surprise.</p>\n  <p>It was N, of course. He was dressed today in a dark red suit, his brooch gold and set in a black velvet tie, fastened around his long neck. It complemented his tan skin. Light seemed to be dancing in his eyes with amusement, and Taekwoon wondered briefly what was hidden behind that smile.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon could sense Hongbin's frown from beside him. For some reason, his cousin had taken a dislike to the man, but Hongbin wouldn't tell him what. 'Just a feeling', Hongbin had said. Hongbin's feelings were rarely wrong, perhaps it was a sense that had been developed, perhaps it was a sense that was innate\u2014but Taekwoon, a little uncharitably, suspected he was just jealous. </p>\n  <p>\"I don't have a choice,\" Taekwoon said, voice flat. It was something he had become accustomed to doing\u2014at this point, it might have been called habit.</p>\n  <p>N sketched a small bow of accedence at that. \"Quite true, but it's a pleasure to see you regardless. Although it seems to be a pleasure not returned, as usual?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned at that, brows drawing tighter. Perversely, N smiled, eyes twinkling.</p>\n  <p>\"And I don't seem to be interrupting anything this time either. Although I suppose that we have established you don't like me very much,\" N said. Taekwoon got the distinct impression that he was being mocked and he pressed his lips together, not deigning that with a response.</p>\n  <p>\"I was wondering if I was imagining it, but you truly do seem like a different person at these functions,\" N commented, ignoring Taekwoon's silence. \"I think I like the other you better.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I dislike these functions,\" Taekwoon said. There was a small cough from beside him, and Taekwoon was fairly sure Hongbin would've laughed, had this been any other situation.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, I could tell,\" N said. \"Given how much time you seem to spend hiding from it all.\"</p>\n  <p>\"They're functionless,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"For you, perhaps. I imagine that they serve quite a function for those less powerful than yourself.\" N inclined his head again, this time, at where people mingled, and where servers carried trays of drinks and whisked away empty glasses. </p>\n  <p>Taekwoon made a sound that could've been agreement or disagreement. Hongbin was shifting restlessly beside him, and Taekwoon glanced at him. It felt odd to have Hongbin hovering\u2014he'd become accustomed to speaking to N alone. Yet, he trusted Hongbin with everything. It was an odd thing to be bothered by. Hongbin caught his eye, and Taekwoon held it for half a second before he looked away.</p>\n  <p>\"I'll take my leave,\" Hongbin said formally. He pushed the book into Taekwoon's hands and then bowed, before disappearing into the crowd, to speak for Taekwoon's behalf. Taekwoon felt a surge of thankfulness and affection for his cousin.</p>\n  <p>\"So stiff,\" N commented. \"Both of you are rather different. Ken was telling me that Hongbin seemed much less...'prickly', I believe the word was.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon barely stifled a small snort of laughter, swallowing it and pressing his lips shut. </p>\n  <p>\"Hongbin is a good man,\" Taekwoon said, words curt, honour bound to defend his cousin.</p>\n  <p>\"I don\u2019t doubt that,\" N said, although his eyes were laughing, full of mirth. He nodded at the book in Taekwoon\u2019s hand. \"Am I keeping you from\u2026\"</p>\n  <p>The man craned about, peering at the spine of the book. Taekwoon turned it, glancing at the title.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, history,\" N said. \"A different volume from the last.\"</p>\n  <p>\"The last?\" Taekwoon frowned.</p>\n  <p>\"You were reading on Lunenthal\u2019s history some time ago,\" N said. \"A different book.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You remember?\" Taekwoon\u2019s frown deepened, because the man was right, on both counts.</p>\n  <p>\"Of course. 'Chronicles of Glory' presents the rise of the Stellar System as a great victory for the people, while\u2026\" N\u2019s eyes flickered towards the cover of Taekwoon\u2019s book \"Now that\u2019s interesting,\" he murmured quietly. He glanced upwards at Taekwoon, his eyes lingering a moment too long on his, a shade too intensely. \"What are you doing with a book like that?\"</p>\n  <p>\"I find it interesting,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Does it not condemn the Stellar System as little different from the old monarchy?\" N asked. His voice had dropped low, because he was right, that it was not a book that Taekwoon should have had. Taekwoon\u2019s face drew tight. He hadn\u2019t thought that he would be seen with it, and he did find it interesting.</p>\n  <p>\"His arguments are not convincing,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, I should have thought you would say that,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon stared at him, and stared at him hard. N seemed unperturbed, however, a small smile playing about his lips, his eyes steady. \"You speak as if you agree,\" Taekwoon said softly.</p>\n  <p>\"I didn\u2019t say that,\" N said. It was almost flippant.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Taekwoon murmured in half agreement. His subsequent silence was enough to mean that there was far more that had gone unsaid. For once, N did not fill that silence, at least not immediately.</p>\n  <p>\"And if I do?\" N spoke softly, his eyes holding Taekwoon's gaze, steady and strong and piercing. \"What would that make you think of me?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon's brows drew deep into a frown as he took in N's words, and perhaps, more importantly, as he tried to puzzle out what he truly meant behind them. It was something that Taekwoon had learned\u2014that words were often not what they seemed, even if he kept his own words plain.</p>\n  <p>\"It would make no difference,\" Taekwoon finally said, words stiff, inflectionless.</p>\n  <p>\"I forgot, you don't think very much of me,\" N said, and his voice had taken on its air of amusement again, its lilt of mirth, any hint of the gravity of the previous few seconds altogether gone. Taekwoon felt a little unanchored. </p>\n  <p>\"If you know, why ask?\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>N shrugged. \"Perhaps because I hope that the answer would change, I suppose,\" he said. \"Perhaps it still will.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I doubt it,\" Taekwoon said, but there was a small waver of hesitation, kept carefully hidden from his voice.</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose I'll simply have to work harder to change your mind, then,\" N said. He smiled at Taekwoon, only there was a hint of something almost predatory in it, a hint of intention that Taekwoon wasn't sure he could quite place.</p>\n  <p>\"Why?\" Taekwoon asked, before he could stop himself. This was answered with a shrug, another strange smile. </p>\n  <p>\"You interest me,\" N said\u2014Taekwoon frowned. \"What sort of man attends a party, only to hide away with a book? And when that man is the heir to one of the Cardinal houses\u2026it adds another layer of interest, I would say. And now...\" N's eyes drifted down to the book in Taekwoon's hand. \"The swiftest current I've met was hidden beneath the stillest surface.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And you wish to interest me,\" Taekwoon said. It was half a question, or perhaps, there was a question hidden within that he wished to ask, but could not bring himself to ask.</p>\n  <p>Another shrug, an open smile. \"If that is how you wish to see it, then I suppose so,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon stared at him, baffled.</p>\n  <p>\"You don't,\" Taekwoon said. The conversation had dragged on long enough. Taekwoon turned, in search of somewhere so hidden that he would not be disturbed, leaving the man to stare, again, at his retreating back.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>There had always been something that had attracted Hakyeon to Lunenthal, as much as he disliked the way it had been stripped of life. Or perhaps that was why, in a perverse way. This job was far from his first time in the city but he would never get used to how dull it seemed, compared to the forests of Etoir, the mountains of Soliaire, and the endless expanse of emerald waves on the other side of those rocky crests. But Lunenthal with its city of bronze and steel, with its intricate designs, with its sense of permanence and immutability...it had a stark beauty of its own, Hakyeon supposed. Yet, he could not imagine living within its bounds, within its walls, surrounded by an eternal faint cloud of smoke.</p>\n  <p>It would sour anyone to life, Hakyeon thought.</p>\n  <p>He perched on the edge of a roof, hidden within the shadows, just inside of the city walls. The walls themselves were an anachronism of more vicious times, when war was brought to the cities themselves, before the three greatest cities carved out parcels of land to hold under their own rule, to satisfy their own egos. There were no guards now, no defenses, the gates all thrown open.</p>\n  <p>It had been almost five years since Hakyeon had split off from mercenary work with his little band. Five years since they'd been paid to defend small towns from skirmishes, since they'd hunted down rebel groups, since they'd fought on both sides in Etoir's civil war, depending on who paid them more. Their blades and guns still went to the highest bidder, but now they were better paid, and their targets smaller in scale.</p>\n  <p>Lunenthal. A city where Hakyeon had spent far too much time in these five years.</p>\n  <p>He slipped off the roof, making his way through the streets instead, a far more familiar route through the city than those blasted carriages. The street lamps slowly grew brighter and more frequent as he neared the center of the city, and the shadows grew fewer for him to hide in. But much of Hakyeon's time in Lunenthal had been spent searching for these shadows, and it was through these shadows that he shifted, steps quiet, movements soft.</p>\n  <p>There was little moon tonight, but had there been one, it would have been obscured by the clouds. The city breathed in a constant hum of thousands upon thousands of metal parts, each interlinked to the next, exhaling in faint puffs of smoke. Hakyeon wound his way through the city, between stone walls and stepping on stone streets, his path meanderingly indirect. </p>\n  <p>The Manor of the Snake had stated its invitation, staked its claim in the never-ending procession of this senseless display of money, the flaunting of power. It would be in three days, and as always, Hakyeon meant to be prepared. </p>\n  <p>Yet, in time, it was the walls of the Azure Keep that Hakyeon found himself nearing. Even though it was pitch night, the towering spires, the great stone arches, the likenesses of the dragons carved and painted against both the Keep itself and the surrounding gate\u2014the place was so illuminated that Hakyeon could pick out each and every detail, albeit bathed in a tinted orange glow. </p>\n  <p>This was where Leo had grown up. The Dragon Lord maintained an even larger estate beyond the walls of the city, Hakyeon knew, but from what Hakyeon had learned over the past few weeks, the family rarely spent time there. Out beyond the bounds of civilisation.</p>\n  <p>\"You.\"</p>\n  <p>A voice\u2014soft, familiar, surprised, and Hakyeon nearly jumped at how unexpected it had been.</p>\n  <p>There, under the shadow of the wall, stood the man who would inherit this Keep.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord,\" Hakyeon said, bowing. </p>\n  <p>\"Why are you here?\" Leo spoke bluntly, and his eyes were sharp in a way that Hakyeon couldn't quite place.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon felt his lips twitch, not entirely voluntarily. \"I'm not quite sure myself, I'm afraid,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"It's the dead of night,\" Leo said\u2014rather unnecessarily, Hakyeon thought, but again, there was something there in his words, in his voice, that Hakyeon could not quite place, and it left him uneasy.</p>\n  <p>\"I'm rather aware,\" Hakyeon said, and this time, the small smile that played on his lips was entirely intentional. He made a show of looking up at the sky before meeting Leo's eyes, keeping amusement in his own. \"I suppose I could ask the same of you\u2014it is, after all, the dead of night.\"</p>\n  <p>Leo's expression tightened, but not in anger. Frustration, perhaps. Irritation? Hakyeon hummed lightly to himself in thought, but audible enough to be heard. No, there was something a little more downcast in it. At Hakyeon's small sound, however, Leo twitched, and his expression again smoothed out.</p>\n  <p>\"I live here,\" Leo said, voice curt. Hakyeon sensed that he would not be getting much more out of him than that.</p>\n  <p>Instead, Hakyeon took a moment to truly take the man in, something that he'd been remiss not to have done immediately, but he had been quite, uncharacteristically, taken by surprise. Leo was not dressed in his usual uniform\u2014the first time Hakyeon had ever seen him out of it. He was wearing a simple white shirt with no embellishments, and a pair of trousers that would not have been out of place in Hakyeon's own closet. No jacket at all\u2014the man had not come outside with intention. It made him seem...younger, Hakyeon decided. Neither was his hair styled in any perceivable manner, dark bangs falling messily over his eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose you do,\" Hakyeon said quietly, more to fill the silence than any other reason.</p>\n  <p>\"But you know that,\" Leo said, and his voice was equally quiet, but there was a hint of something threaded through it that was startlingly unfamiliar and out of place. </p>\n  <p>\"It is a very big place and difficult to miss,\" Hakyeon said, and he was teasing now, uncomfortable that he could not immediately place Leo's tone. \"And it turns out that you are very important after all.\"</p>\n  <p>It had been the wrong thing to say, because it was as if a heavy curtain had been drawn behind Leo's eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Leo said, a near murmur, \"I suppose I am.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon glanced away, uneasy under Leo's stare, disguising it as a sweeping survey of their surroundings instead.</p>\n  <p>\"It's quite different at night,\" Hakyeon said. This earned him no response, although Hakyeon was not truly expecting one, beyond the stony look that he received.</p>\n  <p>He wondered if he should leave, but something held him to the spot, just as something seemed to hold Leo to his place. But where Hakyeon's eyes drifted, Hakyeon could feel Leo's eyes fixed on him.</p>\n  <p>\"You seem different.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon startled a little, both at the words and at the tone of them, gaze snapping back to Leo. His eyes were shadowed, backed by the light as they were, but even so, Hakyeon could pick out the hint of curiosity, dwelling in the tilted corners.</p>\n  <p>\"Do I?\" Hakyeon asked. \"In what way?\"</p>\n  <p>\"You are less...\" Leo paused, frowning, as he regarded Hakyeon. \"Less annoying,\" he settled on.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, a genuine laugh. \"You prefer this?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Leo answered immediately, and then another frown, as he seemed to realise what it was that he'd said. His face grew dark, his eyes hard. \"I would prefer you to leave me alone.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon swallowed\u2014a heaviness settled in his chest, his stomach, the words forming a dark pool of stones that Hakyeon could not manage to dislodge. The smile he managed was weak, and he soon dropped it, hoping that the flicker had been missed in the dim shadow of night.</p>\n  <p>\"That is disappointing,\" Hakyeon said quietly. \"I was hoping that you were beginning to enjoy my company.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I was clear from the start,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"Then I suppose I shall take my leave, my Lord,\" Hakyeon said. He bowed, deeply and formally. \"May the remainder of this night treat you well.\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>The grand hall of the manor was awash with light, colours from the paper lanterns splashing across the walls. Reliefs carved into the stone seemed to glow faintly from the light, giving the jewels embedded in a facsimile of eyes a life of their own. The great pillars of the hall were arranged in a circular shape, with the ceiling opening into a large dome, painted with a great, winding beast of the imagination, its tail coiled about in a spiral. Among the twelve manors, there was no doubt that the Manor of the Snake was one of the more impressive, one of the more grand. It was said to be due to its proximity to the Azure Dragon, but whether or not that was a true fact was lost to the early days of when the people of Lunenthal had dismantled the monarchy, and established the Stellar System to give them their own right to rule.</p>\n  <p>Yet, Taekwoon thought, as he nodded once in acknowledgement as some old fool gave an overly verbose spiel that Taekwoon was only half listening to, perhaps N was right to agree with the heretic idea, that the Stellar System was little different than the monarchy. A monarchy of four families instead of one, albeit a monarchy which had been proven to be mutable, even if it had happened only once. </p>\n  <p>Taekwoon's eyes flickered through the hall, searching through the blur of fashioned uniforms and colourful dresses, but nothing caught his eye. A frown had slowly drawn his brows together, although Taekwoon himself was not quite aware of it. He did, however, wrench his attention back to the one sided conversation the man was having with himself. Something about the mines, Taekwoon remembered.</p>\n  <p>\"...could consider it, my lord, I do believe\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I will take it under consideration,\" Taekwoon said, without knowing what he was considering. He wouldn't consider it, but he wouldn't have considered it even if he had known. His words at least seemed to satisfy the geezer who bowed respectfully first to Taekwoon, and then to someone beside him before he departed.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord.\" It was a familiar voice\u2014Hongbin's voice\u2014by his elbow. There was also a sizable question in those two words that Taekwoon didn't entirely miss.</p>\n  <p>\"What?\" Taekwoon said, a little more curtly than he meant.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin's eyebrows flickered upwards as he gave Taekwoon a strange look. \"Merely surprised to see you here,\" he said, voice quiet.</p>\n  <p>\"I was bored,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"You did look bored,\" Hongbin said. There was a hint of a laugh in those words, as he looked towards where the minister from the House of Rain had disappeared to, a faint look of terror on his face. He shot Taekwoon a mischievous look for all of a second before he smoothed it purposely into something proper. \"Just now, I meant.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon glowered at his cousin. \"You make me do this,\" Taekwoon grumbled, just a little petulant.  </p>\n  <p>\"Not this time,\" Hongbin said. He frowned. </p>\n  <p>\"I thought you wanted me to do this,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin's eyes continued to widen in disbelief, and Taekwoon looked away, eyes flickering again over the crowd.</p>\n  <p>\"Looking for someone?\" Hongbin asked. Taekwoon shook his head.</p>\n  <p>\"There's...so many people,\" Taekwoon said quietly.</p>\n  <p>\"There's always this many people.\" Hongbin's voice was flat and extremely unimpressed. \"You just never meet them.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I...\" Taekwoon shifted a little uncomfortably, although he kept up his veneer of impassivity to the unpracticed eye. Hongbin knew him too well, however, and Taekwoon knew it.</p>\n  <p>\"Well since you're here and not playing hide and seek, you might as well go speak to the ambassador,\" Hongbin said. There was still a hint of skepticism in his voice, but it was altogether mild and pleasant. </p>\n  <p>Taekwoon scanned the crowd, this time looking for this person that Hongbin wished for him to speak to. They settled on the largest knot of people. Seeing his gaze, Hongbin nodded towards the same direction.</p>\n  <p>\"Be polite,\" Hongbin warned.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon gave him a cold look as he strode across the hall, ignoring the way people almost seemed to scramble out of his way.</p>\n  <p>\"Might want to tone down the whole serial killer look,\" Hongbin said, as he lengthened his stride to match Taekwoon's. Not a difficult task, as they were fairly of a height.</p>\n  <p>\"I will kill you,\" Taekwoon muttered under his breath. Hongbin disguised a laugh as a cough but Taekwoon obliged, consciously plastering something that could be approximated as a pleasant look on his face. </p>\n  <p>The circle of people looked up at his approach, many of them with matching looks of slight surprise that were quickly tucked away, some better than others. Taekwoon frowned lightly at them but ignored them in favour of nodding towards the two who must have been from Soliaire, judging from their dress, and the way attention was centered on them.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord,\" the shorter one said, bowing to Taekwoon. This was mirrored by who Taekwoon guessed was his attendant, who wasn't that much taller either.</p>\n  <p>\"Welcome,\" Taekwoon said, slipping into the detached state of mind he kept for such conversations. \"The journey must have been long.\"</p>\n  <p>\"It was fascinating,\" the man said. He smiled, a rather earnest smile that Taekwoon wasn't sure he liked. \"Lunenthal is truly an innovative country\u2014I have heard of trains, but this was my first time riding one. Oh. I have yet to introduce myself, haven't I. This one is called Suho,\" he said, and then bowed formally and deeply.</p>\n  <p>\"This one is called Lay,\" his attendant said, copying the same bow.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon did not bow. \"I am Leo of the Azure Seat of the Dragon,\" he said, as stiff as they had been formal. The gesture left him feeling rather wrongfooted. Hongbin, of course, remained silent, half a pace behind, half a pace beside. He might speak for Taekwoon when Taekwoon was not present, but never over Taekwoon's own voice. But of course, Soliaire would have strange customs.</p>\n  <p>\"It is our honour to meet you,\" Suho said. He smiled at Taekwoon. \"I hope that this visit will be fruitful for both of our countries.\"</p>\n  <p>\"As do I,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"I think that trade would\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Maybe at the meeting in two days?\" The other man\u2014Lay\u2014interrupted what Taekwoon suspected would have been a long, theoretical argument as to exactly how their visit would benefit them both, but in particular, Soliaire. Regardless, Taekwoon nodded at him.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, I believe that would be best,\" Taekwoon said. He glanced at Hongbin, whose eyes flickered only the slightest amount in acknowledgement. Taekwoon breathed an internal sigh of relief.</p>\n  <p>\"Please, enjoy your visit,\" Taekwoon said. \"As your attendant said, we can talk at the meeting.\"</p>\n  <p>A genuine look of surprise passed over Suho's face. \"Oh, no, Lay isn't my attendant,\" he quickly said. A small smile of wry amusement flickered at the corners of Lay's mouth. \"He is my...\"</p>\n  <p>\"Partner, perhaps?\" Lay suggested. His tone was mild and guileless, but Taekwoon had the distinct impression that he was perfectly aware of what the word suggested. Judging from the flat look that Suho gave him, Taekwoon was likely right.</p>\n  <p>\"We are a team,\" Suho said firmly.</p>\n  <p>\"I see,\" Taekwoon said. \"Then, as your partner said, we can talk at the meeting.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Alright,\" Hongbin said, as soon as they'd slipped somewhere fairly secluded, and Hongbin was sure they weren't being overheard. \"What's gotten into you?\"</p>\n  <p>\"I just wanted to ask about the cat,\" Taekwoon said sullenly.</p>\n  <p>\"The\u2014oh for heaven's sake, you were looking for <i>him</i>?\"</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Taekwoon said. </p>\n  <p>Hongbin's face was one of skepticism. \"You said you were bored.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And this boredom had nothing to do with...not being able to have a conversation about that creature.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said again.</p>\n  <p>\"I see.\" Hongbin gave him a flat look that Taekwoon returned firmly. In the end, it was Hongbin who sighed and looked away.</p>\n  <p>\"Either way, he isn't here,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Did you think he would be?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon hesitated, and then shook his head. \"I just wanted to ask about the cat,\" he said again.</p>\n  <p>\"He's far too interested in you,\" Hongbin said. His tone softened. \"He says he has nothing he wants from you, but I doubt it.\"</p>\n  <p>\"He doesn't have a reason,\" Taekwoon retorted.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin raised his eyebrows. \"You're defending him,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon could feel a slight flush rising at the back of his neck. \"No,\" he quickly said. \"I'm stating the truth.\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin scoffed. \"Stating what he tells you is the truth,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't think he's lying,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"It's that blasted creature, isn't it?\" Hongbin asked. The corner of Taekwoon's mouth twitched, but otherwise, he held Hongbin's gaze coolly. </p>\n  <p>\"He's far too interested in you,\" Hongbin repeated. Taekwoon just shrugged.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Something gnawed inside Hakyeon, although he could not quite put a name to it. Nonetheless, he moved gracefully through the floor, mingling so briefly and inanely that no one would pay him any mind, nor remember him after all this was done. There was a trick to being unnoticeable, and it wasn't to hide.</p>\n  <p>And yet:</p>\n  <p>\"You weren't here last time.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon barely caught himself from snapping about, only long practiced restraint lending his turn a more finessed air, although the surprise on his face was far from an act.</p>\n  <p>\"You noticed?\" Hakyeon asked, before he could stop himself.</p>\n  <p>There was a by-now-familiar crease between Leo's brows, as the taller man regarded Hakyeon with a gaze far too intense to be mere curiosity. A small nod, at odds with Leo's eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"The last two times,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"I thought you preferred for me to leave you alone,\" Hakyeon said. The words were softer than he meant them to be, a waver in his confidence.</p>\n  <p>Leo seemed to blink, a moment of confusion flashing through his eyes, the slightest tilt of his head that Hakyeon might have been imagining. </p>\n  <p>\"I was curious about the cat,\" Leo finally said, after several long seconds had passed.</p>\n  <p>\"The cat?\" Something tugged at Hakyeon's chest. It was Hakyeon's turn to frown. \"What for?\"</p>\n  <p>\"I would like to see it again,\" Leo said. His eyes flickered about them for a moment, the muscles in his cheek pulling taut for the briefest second. \"We could talk somewhere quieter.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon too looked about them, although he did not see whatever it was that Leo had seen\u2014if he had been speaking in response to something he had seen at all. Something suddenly occurred to Hakyeon.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not reading,\" he said. It was supposed to be a question, but came out as more of a startled comment than anything else.</p>\n  <p>A faint flush seemed to creep at the tip of Leo's ears, his lips twitching.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Leo said. \"I am not.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon swallowed a smile even as he sketched a bow. \"Perhaps I will come find you later, my lord,\" he said. \"You will be in the most secluded place you can find, I presume?\"</p>\n  <p>\"...\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon took that silent stare for accedence, bowed again, and then meandered back into the crowd, hoping that not too many people had seen him talk to the young lord. The heir to the Seat of the Dragon was unfortunately far from unnoticeable.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>It was a good half hour before Hakyeon felt like his chest had loosened enough for him to go seek out the young lord again. Leo had noticed\u2014his target had noticed that Hakyeon had not been present. It was true, Wonsik had advised him not to attend the one hosted by the Manor of the Snake, with the Soliarian ambassadors present, but Hakyeon had had his own reasons for remaining away. As for missing the one the week prior...Jaehwan had given him enough of an earful for that, despite Hakyeon's insistence that it had been because the ambassadors had yet to depart, even if they would not be in attendance. Yet, Hakyeon had not been able to bring himself to attend. They would, however, be departing today, and Hakyeon\u2019s excuses would no longer hold water.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon looked good today. Dashing, charming. A well fitted suit of dark blue, almost of a colour as Leo's own. His brooch was far less ostentatious, as was only fitting for someone of his much lower status. Although, Hakyeon thought darkly, if any of the people in this room knew of just how much of a lower status he had been born to, they would likely all perish of heart failure. </p>\n  <p>Hakyeon had circled about the Manor of the Boar a few nights ago, as was his custom prior to entering any building which he might have to remain within for some time. He knew the rough layout to the place, although the Manor itself had been hidden behind a thick, stone wall. In a way, the three Manors under each of the Cardinal Seats served as the fortifications for those Keeps, just as the seven Houses served as the outermost defences, two semi-circular rings, opened to where the four Keeps bordered the Parliamentary buildings. The Boar's manor was even stronger fortified than most\u2014Hakyeon had run into one of the blasted things once as a youth, and narrowly escaping being gored by a wild boar was not one of his fonder memories. He imagined that the Manor's design had been modelled after the real creature in some way, just as each of the other Keeps and Manors had been as well, although the memory of the models themselves had crumbled into obscurity. </p>\n  <p>The Great Hall was situated to the eastern side of the building, the windows opening into a starkly beautiful garden\u2014if one could call such a place a garden, when creations of steel far outnumbered those of flowers. Where there should have been the sweet evening song of birds, there was only the grind and rumble of engines and generators, somewhere off in the distance. The garden itself extended only partially about the building, with the other side occupied for far more utilitarian purposes\u2014the stable for the carriages and trucks, various storehouses, and an open patch of ground that was likely used for any number of things. There was no balcony overlooking the Great Hall, nor was there a second floor accessible to any but those who occupied the Manor. Hakyeon suspected the stairs were hidden behind the pair of great doors on the northern side of the hall, opposite of the one that they had entered through. There were a number of small alcoves that Hakyeon breezed past, several of which were occupied. Of course\u2014Hakyeon had heard that tensions had been rising lately between a number of the Manors, although he hadn't kept as abreast of the rumours as he ought to have. Wonsik probably had that in hand.</p>\n  <p>And yet...</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon wandered to where he knew Jaehwan would be. His friend frowned lightly when he saw Hakyeon, but immediately stood and sketched him a bow, before joining him.</p>\n  <p>\"You've kept track of his attendant?\" Hakyeon spoke, voice low and pitched for only Jaehwan to hear.</p>\n  <p>\"Of course,\" Jaehwan said, tone mildly offended. \"Hongbin isn't difficult to keep track of.\"</p>\n  <p>\"So he's still here,\" Hakyeon said softly. </p>\n  <p>\"See for yourself,\" Jaehwan said. He nodded somewhere off to Hakyeon's right\u2014it took some squinting, but Hakyeon eventually did find the man's handsome silhouette, surrounded by a gaggle of colourfully dressed young women.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon's expression tightened. \"I see,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Hak\u2014my lord!\" Jaehwan called to Hakyeon as he turned to go, barely correcting his words. Hakyeon shot him a heavy look.</p>\n  <p>\"Not now,\" he said, brushing Jaehwan off.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon strode to the side of the hall, pace fast and steps quiet. A quick glance behind him, before he slipped out through the service door. The windows were too open, too easily watched. He had to guess at the halls, keep a tally of turns and directions, listening for the slightest footstep or heart beat. Intuition drew him outside, into the night air. There was the faint smell of burning coal, and Hakyeon's nose twitched in irritation. The lights here were dimmer\u2014this was not a place where those beyond the servants were likely to go. </p>\n  <p>He looked around him. Perspective could change everything, and the last time he had seen this place, he had been perched on the roof of a nearby building. Hakyeon was grateful for the light, but it also meant that he felt overly exposed, with none of the usual cloaking safety of darkness as he darted towards the storerooms, checking each one. They were empty, however, and Hakyeon pulled up short, leaning against a wall as he went through his options. If only those blasted engines would quiet, he couldn't <i>think</i> with the sound\u2014</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon swore. Damn things were loud, too loud. The stables were at the opposite end of the grounds. Hakyeon bit at his lip unthinkingly. And then he ran.</p>\n  <p>Blast it all, he'd gotten dim. It was a good five, ten minutes. He couldn't be seen, the roof wasn't an option\u2014it was too high, it would have taken longer to scale the building to cut to the other side than to circle it as he was doing now. By the time he reached the stables, his chest was heaving lightly. But he had been right. Even through the loud whine and rumble of the engines, he could hear the sound of people.</p>\n  <p>Of course the doors were locked. Hakyeon swore silently, staring at the metal gates as if it would help. The building was stone\u2014but even the smallest child knew to leave some air if burning anything, or the air would go bad inside. Hakyeon began to circle the building, but he'd barely gone a few steps before he found what he was looking for. The window was set up high, too high to see into. And it was facing the Manor. Hakyeon looked behind him, but the only window which faced this direction was dark and shuttered. He'd have to risk it.</p>\n  <p>At least, Hakyeon thought, the stone hadn't been smoothed. That didn't mean it was easy, and his fingers ached by the time he reached the window, skin torn, the sleek, shined shoes he wore utterly useless, and if anything, a hindrance. Hakyeon caught his lip between his teeth, and with one last motion, pulled himself high enough to be able to see inside.</p>\n  <p>He truly had been right.</p>\n  <p>For the first time all night, luck was on his side. The window swung open easily when he tugged at it. </p>\n  <p>His eyes immediately went to the flurry of activity in the space just inside the door\u2014two men scuffling with Leo, who was moving far too sluggishly. They hadn't seen Hakyeon just yet, but it was impossible not to see him when he jumped to the ground.</p>\n  <p>\"You...?\" Leo spoke first, the moment of confusion earning him a heavy blow against the side of his head. Hakyeon swore, loudly, as the man crumpled to the ground.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not his attendant,\" one of the men said, pausing with a frown. The other opted to lunge straight at Hakyeon.</p>\n  <p>He was fast\u2014Leo had been holding his own admirably well, given his state. Hakyeon barely ducked to the side, wincing when a blade appeared in the man's hand, just catching the side of his arm. The man was fast, but so was Hakyeon. Fast enough to grab the man by the wrist, twisting his arm and forcing him to drop the knife. The other assailant had gotten over his second of surprise, and this time, Hakyeon was not so lucky to dodge the blow. He grunted, the breath knocked out of him as he stumbled backwards, a sharp pain against his chest.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon steadied himself. Behind them, Leo had sat up\u2014Hakyeon allowed himself a moment of relief before he turned his full attention on the two attackers. The knife was an arm's length away from Hakyeon, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to risk the moment it would take to grab it from the floor. But on the other hand, it was likely the other man would also be armed\u2014both of them might still be armed.</p>\n  <p>It was a heartbeat's decision, honed through years of training and costly experience. Hakyeon threw himself towards the second assailant, staring him down as he did so. The man faltered, caught off guard at Hakyeon's aggression, but Hakyeon had never intended to attack him, catching the first man with an outstretched arm instead, pivoting about and smashing his elbow into his face. He didn't quite manage to hit his nose, but it was still a hard enough blow that it left him reeling, giving Hakyeon enough time to knock him unconscious with a second hit. The other man stared wide eyed at Hakyeon and then lunged\u2014his mistake, because in the commotion, he hadn't noticed Leo get to his feet behind them. It was Hakyeon's turn to freeze in surprise. There was no hesitation in Leo's attack, a swift blow to the man's neck, leaving him crumpling to the ground, much as Leo had done earlier.</p>\n  <p>\"I didn't need help,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, short and harsh. He took in the young lord's appearance, letting his gaze sweep over him pointedly. There would be some vivid bruises on his face soon, and his jacket was heavily scuffed, and in places, torn. His hair was well and truly mussed, and Hakyeon caught sight of small rivulets of blood by his temple that he'd missed at first glance.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon murmured anyway. \"They wouldn't have killed you.\"</p>\n  <p>Confusion passed over Leo's face, and Hakyeon returned it with a small smile. \"Your life force is too strong,\" he said. \"Their intent would never have matched it...if that had been their intent at all.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon frowned as he knelt down next to the two unconscious forms. They were dressed simply, in the manner from Lunenthal, but Hakyeon had caught sight of what he was sure were Soliarian charms during the brief fight. Sure enough, when he tugged down one of the men's shirts, ignoring Leo's aborted surprise behind him, the man was wearing a shirt in the Soliarian style, decoratively hemmed cotton, cut so that it made a fetching line diagonally across the chest, cloth clasps around simple buttons. Hakyeon's frown only deepened as he stood.</p>\n  <p>\"Soliaire?\" he said quietly.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not who you say you are.\" Leo's voice was soft behind him. Soft, yet bold.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon turned, giving him a quirk of a smile, the barest hint of a raised brow. \"Astute observation,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>A slight sting at his arm caught his attention, and when Hakyeon pressed his hand against it, he came away with blood. There were small splatters of red elsewhere, from where he'd torn his fingers, scaling the wall. Hints of pain began to seep through to his consciousness, and with it, a wave of actual, conscious thought, especially as his words caught up to him.</p>\n  <p>His heart plummeted, although he kept the smile on his face.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon said, forcing down apprehension, \"they didn't mean to kill you\u2014at least, not here or now.\"</p>\n  <p>\"How do you know that?\" Leo asked. His brows were drawn in a severe way, but his breathing was laboured, and Hakyeon was struck with how poor of a facade the young lord was managing.</p>\n  <p>\"You must be able to feel it,\" Hakyeon said mildly. \"Some sort of poison, yet not lethal. Fast acting, fast enough to leave you dazed enough so they could get you out of the hall, yet not kill you. Profol, perhaps. Now, did they mean to kill you elsewhere, or merely to kidnap you...\" Hakyeon's eyes flickered to the still forms, arching his brows in such a way to say that only they could answer that. He shrugged. \"Clever, hiding the sounds with the carriage engines. Fooled me as well.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Why?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon blinked. \"How am I to know?\" </p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Leo said. He shook his head. \"Why did you come find me?\"</p>\n  <p>\"This isn't quite what I imagined when you said somewhere quieter, although it is rather secluded, I suppose,\" Hakyeon said, sidestepping the question. But Leo was like that blasted cat, once it had gotten hold of something it'd decided it wanted.</p>\n  <p>\"Why did you come find me?\" he repeated.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon sighed, a little dramatically. \"I did say you interest me,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Yet, you are not who you say you are,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>A smile quirked at Hakyeon's lips. \"No, I suppose not.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Then why?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Let's just say I am rather invested in keeping you alive,\" Hakyeon said. He swallowed down the lie, letting a practiced smile fill the space. He glanced towards the doors, still locked. \"They'll find you missing, soon.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Go.\" The word caught him off guard\u2014the tone even more so.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon turned back to Leo. It was clear that standing was becoming an effort, and Hakyeon wondered what injuries were hidden by his clothes.</p>\n  <p>\"Before they come,\" Leo added. \"You need to leave.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded, automatically. \"You fought them alone,\" Hakyeon said. He looked Leo straight in the eye, matching Leo's steady gaze. Hakyeon looked away, ignoring the sudden pang in his chest. One of the men stirred.</p>\n  <p>\"Go,\" Leo repeated.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon turned his eyes towards the two men, slowly returning to consciousness. \"Yes,\" he said. First, however, he walked towards the dropped knife and quickly drew the blade across the two men's throats, severing them with deep cuts. He could feel the faint horror from behind him, but Hakyeon steadfastly ignored it.</p>\n  <p>\"Be safe,\" Hakyeon said. He tossed the knife behind him in Leo's vague direction and then unlocked the doors, slipping through them into the dimly lit night before shutting them behind him once again, leaving Leo and two dead bodies behind them.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"Are you <i>daft</i>?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon had barely come into view when Jaehwan launched himself at him, knocking Hakyeon flat on his back, head colliding with the ground with a painful thud. He snarled, throwing Jaehwan off, sending him flying into Wonsik who grabbed him before he could throw himself at Hakyeon again, this time with far more fist and intent to cause damage than his initial burst of upset.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon swore under his breath as he got to his feet. \"Are <i>you</i> daft?\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan's eyes flashed in anger as he shook off Wonsik. \"I'm not going to hit him,\" he growled at Wonsik. \"Although he deserves it.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And pray, why do I 'deserve it'?\" Hakyeon asked, voice dropping dangerously low. </p>\n  <p>\"Why? <i>Why?</i> You're asking me why? You tell me why\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Jaehwan, calm down.\" Wonsik grabbed Jaehwan's shoulder, and was shaken off again.</p>\n  <p>\"He <i>saved the target's life</i>,\" Jaehwan snapped. \"He saved the life of the person he's supposed to be <i>killing</i>.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You don't trust my judgement,\" Hakyeon said. He met Jaehwan's eyes steadily, cooly, matching Jaehwan's flare of anger with an equally frigid stare.</p>\n  <p>\"Well <i>excuse me</i> when your <i>judgement</i> seems to be completely twisted!\" Jaehwan spun about to face Wonsik. \"Apparently someone tried to kill the target, but the target fought the assailants off and killed them both.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Sounds believable,\" Hakyeon said, keeping his voice pleasant. </p>\n  <p>\"Right,\" Jaehwan said, turning back to Hakyeon with a snarl. \"Believable.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Jaehwan\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"You want me to believe that the <i>target</i> cleanly slit two men's throats\u2014while drugged\u2014when Hakyeon just <i>happened</i> to disappear from the hall after asking whether or not the target's attendant was still there?\"</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon said calmly. \"I don't want you to believe anything.\"</p>\n  <p>Wonsik looked at Hakyeon, and it was not a particularly happy look. \"Sorry Hakyeon, I think I might agree with Jaehwan on this one,\" he said. \"Never mind that you protected the target, but... you killed those men in front of the target. That's...\"</p>\n  <p>\"You too?\" Hakyeon shot Wonsik an icy look. \"Does this timing not seem strange to any of you? An attack, apparently by Soliarians, the very day the Soliarian ambassadors are to depart?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Soliarians?\" Jaehwan pulled up short.</p>\n  <p>\"They didn't say?\" Hakyeon frowned, a little surprised.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan slowly shook his head. \"No,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Someone must be trying to incite war between Soliaire and Lunenthal,\" Hakyeon reasoned slowly. \"But the time isn't right, it would undo everything our employer wishes for, even if the intermediate result\u2014Leo's death\u2014is the same.\"</p>\n  <p>\"The damage is done, though,\" Wonsik said, voice soft. \"The tensions will rise.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps, but with Leo alive, and if the Soliarians can prove their innocence, there is a chance that it won't come to that.\" Hakyeon shrugged, affecting a far more relaxed air than he felt, his stomach churning with worry. \"No, this may work to our advantage. With Leo in a weakened state, it would be a perfect opportunity for one of the Cardinal Seats to strike\u2014or so people will assume. He is alive, yes, and perhaps his guard will be increased, and so his death may serve to have an even greater impact.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan and Wonsik were both looking at him now, really looking, and Hakyeon knew that he had their attention. He smiled, just a hint of teeth.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't believe Leo will give me away,\" Hakyeon said. \"Which will make this all the easier.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You want to turn this to our advantage,\" Jaehwan said slowly. </p>\n  <p>\"I see no reason why it should not be,\" Hakyeon said. A faint ball of relief was settling inside of him now, mixed with something far more unsettling that Hakyeon purposefully ignored.</p>\n  <p>The look Jaehwan gave him was still skeptical. \"Alright,\" he said. \"Fine.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I'll let it slide, this time,\" Hakyeon said. He stared down Jaehwan, mustering every ounce of authority he had. Jaehwan, gratifyingly, seemed to shrink back, eyes shifting away.</p>\n  <p>\"I believe he may trust me now,\" Hakyeon mused. He rubbed at his fingers, the motion sending small sparks of pain shivering up his arms as it jostled the raw skin. The look on Leo's face had been strangely calm\u2014perhaps he had been dazed, yet it had no doubt been more than that. Hakyeon tucked away the frown that came with that thought and made a minute gesture with his head. \"At least more than he did.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Even though he knows you've been lying about who you are?\" Wonsik frowned at Hakyeon.</p>\n  <p>\"I told him I was rather invested in keeping him alive,\" Hakyeon said, swallowing down the seed of guilt once more at the lie. Again, the hint of a smile was a tad more feral than pleasant. \"I simply didn't tell him it was only for now, and why.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Alright,\" Wonsik said reluctantly. \"What's done is done I guess.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Fine,\" Jaehwan repeated. And then paused. \"Does this mean we don't need that creature anymore?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon hummed in thought. \"No,\" he said. \"I think he'll be rather happy to see the cat. He did ask after it.\"</p>\n  <p>This time, he ignored Jaehwan's squawk of protest and subsequent iteration of why it was a terrible idea in favour of stalking towards Sanghyuk's house. He needed a shower, and a good, long sleep.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shifted a little, resting his head more comfortably against Hongbin, taking care not to press his bruised cheek against his cousin's bony shoulder. Hongbin sighed, deep and long suffering, but didn't push Taekwoon away. The sun through the window was comfortable and warm, and Taekwoon liked lying on the couch in it, half draped over Hongbin, who was also warm, albeit not as comfortable as the couch. It was a trade off, but one that Taekwoon was willing to take. </p>\n  <p>They'd fussed over Taekwoon for a good part of the night before finally letting him sleep, telling him he needed plenty of rest. Taekwoon had barely stopped himself from snapping that he would've been getting rest if they hadn't been nagging at him. The effects of the poison, whatever it had been, had all but worn off although he couldn't shake the lingering nausea or headache. N had been right\u2014they couldn't have intended to kill him. He was bruised some, moving his face hurt, his head throbbed, and he'd been told that his arm had been fractured, but none of his injuries suggested they'd meant to deal a lethal blow. Nor had the knife come out until after N had shown up. In hindsight, Taekwoon should have realised this, although none of it meant that he would have gone quietly with whatever they had planned. Being killed later wasn't any better than being killed on the spot, Taekwoon thought grimly. </p>\n  <p>\"You're heavy,\" Hongbin said. Taekwoon's only answer was to wrap his arms around Hongbin a little tighter.</p>\n  <p>\"Stop moving,\" Taekwoon mumbled. \"You're supposed to be nice to me right now.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You're making that very difficult,\" Hongbin said darkly. He sighed again, this time a sigh that was directed more at himself than at Taekwoon, a distinction that went unnoticed by the other. Guilt gnawed within him that he had allowed this to have happened at all, and it was only the relief that it had been right to force Taekwoon to learn how to really fight that assuaged that guilt at all.  </p>\n  <p>\"They've been questioning them since this morning,\" Hongbin said, after a few minutes.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon lifted his head from Hongbin's shoulder, blinking at him sleepily. \"Who?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Those ambassadors from Soliaire,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>\"Oh.\" Taekwoon frowned, remembering the way N had pulled down one of the attackers' shirts, and vaguely recalled N's expression at what he had seen. The memory dragged in another with it, the one he'd been avoiding. The fluidity with which N had killed those two men, as if the act had been nothing to him. It probably had been. Taekwoon felt something twist within him, perhaps the nausea that had stubbornly refused to disappear.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin smiled grimly. \"They weren't too keen on coming quietly. Or cooperating,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Let's just say at least one of them won't be running away any time soon.\" Hongbin's breath of laughter was dark, and had Taekwoon been looking, his eyes were equally hard.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned. \"That's where you were,\" he said slowly. \"Last night.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hm.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon fell silent, dropping his head against Hongbin again. There was something wrong about all of this, but he couldn't tell what. Someone had remembered seeing those men among the ambassadors' entourage, but even then, something felt off.  </p>\n  <p>\"Taekwoon...\" Hongbin spoke softly, hesitantly. Taekwoon hummed some sort of acknowledgement, a question for him to continue. \"You really fought them off yourself. There wasn't anyone else there.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Really.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon nodded, swallowing down the lie. The movement jostled one of the more tender parts of his face against Hongbin, and he winced at the streak of pain.</p>\n  <p>There was a knock at the door. \"My lord.\" It was one of the servants</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon sat up as Hongbin gently pushed him off so he could walk about to open the door. \"What is it?\" Hongbin asked.</p>\n  <p>\"There's someone to see Lord Leo,\" the servant said. \"Would you like me to send him away?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Who is it?\" Taekwoon asked. He turned, sighing internally as he put his proper face back on. </p>\n  <p>\"He said his name was Ken,\" the servant said.</p>\n  <p>\"Ken?\" Hongbin glanced back at Taekwoon, even as Taekwoon's heart skipped a beat.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said immediately.</p>\n  <p>\"I'm not sure if\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Bring him here,\" Taekwoon said. A flutter of excitement at seeing N\u2014at seeing the cat again skimmed across his chest. He frowned at Hongbin and Hongbin had no choice but to quiet, unable to defy Taekwoon in front of others\u2014and Taekwoon knew it. The servant bowed and retreated to do as Taekwoon had asked.</p>\n  <p>\"This is not a good idea,\" Hongbin said, as soon as he'd closed the door. Taekwoon shrugged, and then immediately grimaced.</p>\n  <p>\"Why not?\" Taekwoon shot back.</p>\n  <p>\"You need to rest,\" Hongbin said. It clearly wasn't the reason and Taekwoon glowered at him. Hongbin stared back just as obstinately. </p>\n  <p>\"I'm resting,\" Taekwoon said. \"I'm not moving.\"</p>\n  <p>\"This is not a good idea,\" Hongbin repeated, but there was a knock on the door and Hongbin settled with giving Taekwoon one last sharp look before opening it.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord.\" Ken greeted Taekwoon respectfully, before Hongbin led him into the room. He hovered for a moment, unsure of where to take him, but Taekwoon got to his feet, ignoring the way his body screamed at him, and walked stiffly towards where a few chairs were arranged by some small tables and sat down in front of them.</p>\n  <p>\"What do you want?\" Hongbin asked Ken, blunt.</p>\n  <p>Irritation flashed across Ken's face, brief but obvious, although he continued to face Taekwoon, not Hongbin.</p>\n  <p>\"My lord heard that you had been injured, and wished to inquire if you wanted to see...the cat again.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Did he now,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>This time, Ken did turn to give Hongbin a flat look, but looked away quickly when Hongbin simply glared.</p>\n  <p>\"That's what he said,\" Ken said, and it was clear that he was about as happy as Hongbin about this whole thing.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon, on the other hand, was another story.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon said, before Hongbin could interject with a refusal. He looked at Hongbin, pleading with his eyes as much as he dared.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hongbin said anyway. \"He is not going to see that creature. Also, there's no need for you to come every time. Mail exists.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Why bother when my lord has his personal mail man,\" Ken said. \"And he thought that this would be...more efficient.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Taekwoon repeated. \"Tell him I said yes.\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin pressed his lips together, giving Taekwoon a hard look, even as Ken bowed slightly in accedence. \"Is there a time and place most convenient for you?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ask Gongchan to ask Sandeul if we can use his apartment again?\" Taekwoon asked Hongbin.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin looked faintly murderous at this point, standing slightly behind Ken as he was, now. Blast, Taekwoon had turned on those puppy eyes again.</p>\n  <p>\"Fine,\" Hongbin said, voice curt.</p>\n  <p>\"Then tomorrow, same place,\" Taekwoon said to Ken.</p>\n  <p>\"You can't just decide that,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>\"Why not?\" Taekwoon glanced at Hongbin. </p>\n  <p>\"We haven't even\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Tomorrow, two hours after noon, same place,\" Taekwoon said, cutting Hongbin off. \"Tell him that.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Very well,\" Ken said. He bowed, and looked more than a little relieved as he retreated. </p>\n  <p>\"If you weren't hurt I would hurt you right now,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon blinked. \"You're supposed to be nice to me,\" he said. \"Now go ask Gongchan about it? And tell him it's really important?\"</p>\n  <p>\"You are unbelievable,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>\"Mmmhmm.\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Wonsik dropped them off a distance away and would pick them up later, just as he had last time. Dark smoke billowed from the carriage, its metal wheels making a horrible, clattering racket against the stone street. Hakyeon truly hated the blasted things.</p>\n  <p>\"It's not too late,\" Jaehwan muttered. \"Get Wonsik, turn around, go back.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Not now,\" Hakyeon said. The wicker basket that he was carrying wobbled as the cat moved about inside, and Hakyeon steadied it with one hand, hoping the thing would keep quiet enough to not attract attention.</p>\n  <p>He could feel Jaehwan seething beside him but couldn't find it in him to properly chastise him at the moment. He'd deal with him after they got back.</p>\n  <p>\"I told you not to come,\" Hakyeon said. He glanced at the various buildings as they passed. Well off enough, nice places. He remembered the apartment they'd come to last time\u2014it belonged to someone named Sandeul, Jaehwan had said, House of the Monkey.</p>\n  <p>\"You said you'd leave me behind, there's a difference,\" Jaehwan snapped. \"I'm not letting you out of my sight if you're going to talk to the target.\"</p>\n  <p>\"If you're going to act so childishly, you can stay outside,\" Hakyeon said. His stomach churned with unease as he stopped in front of the agreed on meeting place. The cat made a small sound, but it was quiet enough for no one to notice. The sooner they were inside the better. Hakyeon took a deep breath, then reached for the knocker, giving it three sharp raps.</p>\n  <p>\"So are you going to make a fuss, or are you going to come in?\" Hakyeon stared at Jaehwan hard. Jaehwan pressed his lips into a thin line as he glowered back at him, his silence answer enough. There were footsteps approaching on the other side of the door, and Hakyeon gave Jaehwan another grim look. \"Then be good.\"</p>\n  <p>The door swung open to reveal Hongbin, his jaw set in a way that made it clear he was about as happy about this whole thing as Jaehwan was. Well the two of them could keep each other company.</p>\n  <p>\"Aren't you going to invite us in?\" Hakyeon asked breezily. He didn't wait before stepping forward\u2014Hongbin moved aside reluctantly, partially out of surprise.</p>\n  <p>\"Seems like I didn't need to,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan pursed his lips but followed Hakyeon inside, giving Hongbin an irritated look as he passed by, although whether it was at Hongbin or because of Hakyeon was an open question. Hakyeon ignored them, or he ignored them as best as he could. The unease from earlier had grown and was now tangled around his chest, tendrils slipping into the spaces between his ribs, tightening about his bones. The cat was shifting restlessly inside the basket, its sounds having grown louder and more whiny.</p>\n  <p>The sound of footsteps approaching\u2014Hakyeon pulled up short when Leo appeared in the hall. Hakyeon had been right about the bruises. One side of Leo's face was an ugly, mottled purple. He was also dressed far more simply today than Hakyeon was used to seeing him, a simple brown vest over his shirt, unadorned, albeit neatly buttoned and of clearly high quality. Hakyeon, in his formal uniform, felt terribly overdressed. There was a hint of something in Leo's eyes that Hakyeon couldn't quite place, something between curiosity and wariness, perhaps, but that could have been Hakyeon's imagination.</p>\n  <p>He swallowed down his apprehension, and lifted a corner of his mouth in a smile.</p>\n  <p>\"Some ladies do go for the roughed up look, I suppose,\" Hakyeon teased.</p>\n  <p>Leo paused, and Hakyeon waited for a scowl of displeasure that never came. Instead, Leo's eyes went to the basket in Hakyeon's hand.</p>\n  <p>\"It's in there?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded, and then sighed deeply. \"No greeting for me?\" he asked, and then nodded down the hall where Leo had come, to the sitting room that they had used last time. \"Shall we go?\"</p>\n  <p>Leo nodded, although his eyes lingered on the basket a moment longer before he led the way, Hongbin and Jaehwan trailing behind them, both prickling with irritation. Hakyeon followed Leo's back, catching on the way his shoulder seemed tense, and how he was favouring one leg, just the tiniest. Hakyeon caught sight of an ugly bruise just visible at the end of Leo's sleeve that Hakyeon suspected extended far up his arm. Leo was vulnerable right now, incredibly so. He could've likely fought back, but with both him and Ken here, there was no question that they could kill him, as long as Ken held Hongbin back long enough for Hakyeon to deal the killing blow. Hakyeon swallowed, and tucked the thought away.</p>\n  <p>\"Here.\" Leo's voice pulled Hakyeon the rest of the way out of his thoughts as they turned into the familiar room. Like last time, Hakyeon moved past Leo to place the wicker basket on the table. The cat jumped out as soon as Hakyeon unlatched the top\u2014Hakyeon might have been imagining it, but the cat's glare of disdain at him reminded Hakyeon eerily of Leo. Hakyeon wrinkled his nose at the creature.</p>\n  <p>\"Well, here it is,\" Hakyeon said grandly, making a sweeping gesture of his arm that was utterly ignored as Leo hurried past him to crouch down at the table. Hakyeon sighed deeply, turning to Jaehwan and Hongbin who both looked utterly unimpressed. Hakyeon gave them both a very flat look.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin snorted and Jaehwan shrugged.</p>\n  <p>\"How do you feel knowing you're less important than that thing?\" Hongbin asked.</p>\n  <p>\"Hongbin. Go away.\" Hakyeon and Hongbin both looked at Leo with matching looks of wide-eyed surprise, but Leo was still facing away from them, scratching under the creature's chin.</p>\n  <p>\"But\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Go away,\" Leo repeated. \"You're hovering. And it's a cat.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Blasted thing,\" Hongbin muttered. Hakyeon turned around in time to catch Hongbin's murderous glance before Hongbin pivoted to stalk away\u2014and then came back to snag Jaehwan.</p>\n  <p>\"Hey\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"If I'm going then you're coming with me,\" Hongbin said. Jaehwan turned to look at Hakyeon, who merely smiled at him pleasantly and shrugged.</p>\n  <p>\"Well, go on,\" Hakyeon said. \"You two enjoy your play date.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan mouthed something at him that was probably extremely rude as Leo made a sound that may have been a laugh. Hakyeon couldn't help the smile that grew wider, even as Hongbin physically dragged Jaehwan out of the room with him.</p>\n  <p>\"We're alone,\" Leo said, once Hongbin and Jaehwan had been gone for a good time.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded, although Leo missed it as Hakyeon was still standing behind him. He moved about Leo, crouching down next to him. Leo glanced at him as he did but his eyes quickly went back to the cat, which had lay down on the table, purring in pleasure as Leo rubbed at its head.</p>\n  <p>\"Should I be worried?\" Hakyeon teased. Leo gave him a strange look. \"For my virtue, I mean.\"</p>\n  <p>This drew a sudden flush from Leo that was quickly replaced by irritation. \"You have none,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"You wound me,\" Hakyeon said. He slowly reached forward, past Leo, to place his hand on the cat's back. He could feel its heartbeat underneath his palm, faint though it was. The cat opened one of its eyes, regarding Hakyeon with some suspicion, even though Hakyeon had done his fair share of feeding the thing over the past few weeks.</p>\n  <p>Only the low rumble of the cat's purr filled the silence of the room as Hakyeon stroked down the cat's back and Leo scratched behind its ears. Hakyeon glanced at Leo\u2014that same small smile of contentment from Hakyeon's memory was there again, his eyes soft in fondness, despite the vivid injuries to his face. He didn't seem to notice Hakyeon watching but Hakyeon turned his eyes back to the cat anyway, just in case. Leo's hands were large, his fingers long, and on the back of his hand were parallel red marks, albeit much faded.</p>\n  <p>Unconsciously, Hakyeon's hand had drifted further up the cat's back as he'd pet it\u2014it was with abrupt realisation how close Leo's hands were. Hesitantly, with a quick glance at the other man, Hakyeon let his hand slide up further, slowly, as casually as he could, letting his hand just brush against the tips of Leo's fingers.</p>\n  <p>Leo's eyes widened even as Hakyeon's breath hitched. Leo jerked his hand away, while sparks skittered across Hakyeon\u2019s skin\u2014he too pulled his hand back. He could feel Leo's eyes on him, but Hakyeon didn't dare look, staring instead at the cat which had opened its eyes, irritated at the sudden lack of touch. Hakyeon hastily went to pet it again, but the cat flashed its claws at him, and Hakyeon yanked his hand back before he could have a repeat of Leo's initial encounter with the cat.</p>\n  <p>\"It doesn't like you,\" Leo said softly.</p>\n  <p>\"Ungrateful creature,\" Hakyeon muttered. The cat, however, was unaffected by Hakyeon's displeasure, and merely hopped off the table to land lightly on its feet. Both Leo and Hakyeon watched as it rubbed his head against Leo's leg, winding his way around him.</p>\n  <p>\"It can tell,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"Tell what?\"</p>\n  <p>\"That you're not a good person.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon fell silent, looked away. He shifted so he was sitting on the ground instead as he continued to watch as Leo pet the cat's head, soft and slow. Many heartbeats passed in that montage, before the cat lay down on the ground, belly up, a clear invitation for Leo to pet its stomach. Leo let out a delighted laugh as he obliged.</p>\n  <p>\"You're so soft,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon felt his heart twinge. He thought about shifting closer, about reaching around Leo, about rubbing the cat's stomach the same way Leo was, to let his hand brush against Leo's again\u2014he didn't.</p>\n  <p>\"And you are a good one?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n  <p>Leo turned to look at him, frowning lightly, before his gaze grew sharp as he understood what Hakyeon meant.</p>\n  <p>\"Better than you,\" Leo said. \"I've never...\" He trailed off, looked away uncomfortably\u2014they both knew what Leo meant.</p>\n  <p>\"Hm.\" Hakyeon shrugged, his own eyes unwavering. \"I imagine your attendant may have done the same.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hongbin?\" Leo stared at him now, and Hakyeon could feel the slight hostility radiating from the man.</p>\n  <p>\"He's very protective of you,\" Hakyeon said, keeping his voice light. \"You know that he hunted down those Soliarian ambassadors himself as soon as he knew, right?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Leo said. \"He told me.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, then you must know that they put up quite a fight. It's just a rumour, maybe you know better, but it's being said that he broke their knees, at the very least.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon watched Leo carefully, catching the small jolt of his arm, an aborted motion of surprise. Leo said nothing, however, merely turned back to the cat.</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps\u2014\" Hakyeon stopped, caught himself, freezing under Leo's sudden glance. </p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps what?\" Leo asked softly. Hesitantly.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon murmured. \"It's nothing.\"</p>\n  <p>Perhaps he would've killed them too, if they hadn't needed to question them, Hakyeon swallowed. Perhaps he would've slain them far more brutally than I would have, he did not say.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon watched as Leo turned back to the cat, as the tension in his eyes slowly melted away, as the line of his jaw relaxed. Hakyeon had never truly noticed how soft looking Leo's cheeks were, how gentle his smile was, his face swollen and bruised though it was. The cat purred in pleasure, paws tucked up to its chest. Eventually, it stood, rolling onto its side and twisting upright in one smooth motion. Leo blinked, a little mournful, but the cat only walked the few steps around Leo, before dropping onto the ground between Leo and Hakyeon. Leo looked at Hakyeon, and it was hard to say who was more surprised. The cat made a plaintive sound, almost like a child crying, and it was clear what it wanted.</p>\n  <p>Slowly, because its nails had looked awfully sharp, and Hakyeon couldn't help but feel like this was some sort of trap, he neared his hand towards it. The cat's eyes were sharp on him, wary, and Hakyeon realised abruptly how vulnerable the thing was like this, on its back, belly up. Hakyeon smiled a little\u2014how could he be afraid of something as small as this, that was undoubtedly more frightened of what he could do?</p>\n  <p>\"It is soft,\" Hakyeon said, burying his fingers in its fur.</p>\n  <p>\"And warm,\" Leo added. Hakyeon glanced up from the cat as Leo sat, crossing his legs.</p>\n  <p>\"I can see why you like it so much,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>Leo frowned at him in confusion. \"Does it not live with you?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon shrugged and chuckled. \"As you said, it doesn't seem to like me very much.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon just shrugged again, pulling his hand back to watch Leo rub the creature's belly, his hand nearly covering the entire thing at once. Every time he moved, his sleeve would slide up just enough for Hakyeon to again see the vivid, purpling marks. It would be some time before they would fade, another week at least. </p>\n  <p>It was hard to say how much time had passed, with nothing but three sets of heartbeats and three sets of breaths and the pleased rumbling purr of the cat. Sometimes, Hakyeon would reach out to give the cat a scratch under its chin, prompting a burst of even louder rumbling. Leo looked up at that, his cheeks scrunching up, eyes curling into crescents, and Hakyeon's heart lurched at how bright his smile was, and unwittingly, a smile spread across his own face, open and easy. The same smile lingered even as Leo went back to staring at the cat, murmuring soft phrases to it that Hakyeon couldn't quite hear, but their meaning was clear enough in Leo's tone.</p>\n  <p>It was hard to say how much time had passed when the cat rolled to its feet again. This time, it walked a few short steps away before it sat down to lick at its paw.</p>\n  <p>A strange silence descended, a stifling one, as if the cat's movement had broken some spell.</p>\n  <p>\"You are not who you said you are,\" Leo said, several long moments later.</p>\n  <p>\"And yet, you seem not to have told anyone,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>Leo looked at him sharply. \"Why would I?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Why should you not?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n  <p>Leo shook his head. \"I have no reason to,\" he said, before he paused. \"Will you continue being who you are not?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon inclined his head at that, allowing Leo to derive meaning from the motion as he would. The cat had taken to licking its other paw now, glancing up at the pair of them every now and then.</p>\n  <p>\"Why?\"</p>\n  <p>\"We all have our places in this world,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"You're a murderer.\"</p>\n  <p>All of a sudden, those vines of uncertainty clutched and clamped about his chest again. \"I prefer the term mercenary,\" Hakyeon said, forcing lightness into his voice.</p>\n  <p>\"So you're paid to kill people,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"You pay your soldiers to kill people,\" Hakyeon commented. \"Or your father does. Your country does.\"</p>\n  <p>\"They do it for the good of the country,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, yes. For the good of the country's coffers, to protect the mines that Lunenthal so dearly depends on,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"You speak as if you are not from Lunenthal,\" Leo said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon smiled at that, a far more bitter smile than he had shown in the past hour or so. \"No, I was born and raised in this country just as you were,\" he said, and it was not a lie. It had simply not always been a part of Lunenthal, although that part of his hometown's history had been from long before Hakyeon had been born. This, however, Hakyeon kept to himself. </p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon said again. \"My blade simply goes to the highest bidder.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And if the highest bidder asked you to kill me?\" Leo asked.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon said nothing, merely watched as the cat wet its paw and then brushed it against its face, repeating the motion until it had deemed its face to be clean.</p>\n  <p>\"I hope your enemies never find me.\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Time passed, bruises faded, injuries healed, and Taekwoon reluctantly knew that his pleasant days of sleep, food, and lack of meetings and balls both were coming to an end. Gongchan had been about and Hongbin had attended one or two functions in Taekwoon's place, as his own birthright guaranteed him a spot among Lunenthal's elite, regardless of his position as Taekwoon's attendant. It meant that Taekwoon could ask them both about the going-ons outside of the Keep, and that he could learn that N was oft in attendance, regardless of Taekwoon's own absence.</p>\n  <p>\"Now you're the one too interested in him,\" Hongbin said. He shrugged his shoulder, dislodging Taekwoon from where he'd been clinging to Hongbin again.</p>\n  <p>\"I'm not,\" Taekwoon said, stubborn.</p>\n  <p>\"Then why do you care whether or not he was there?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon pressed his lips together, wrapping his arms around Hongbin a little tighter and jamming his chin against Hongbin's shoulder a little firmer. \"I don't,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>Hongbin sighed in exasperation.</p>\n  <p>He still had something to do then, N. Someone to kill, perhaps. The thought twisted at Taekwoon's gut as he wondered who it was. And yet\u2014</p>\n  <p>The way his smile had lit up his face, how simple it had been, how much there had been nothing behind it, no twist of an agenda, none of the affectation that Taekwoon had sensed was present behind his every word. It had stripped away the mask that Taekwoon was so used to seeing, not only on N, but on every person he had ever spoken to, bar Hongbin. It had stripped N bare to his true self, and it was one that Taekwoon could not believe was truly bad.</p>\n  <p>\"You can't hide here forever,\" Hongbin said. Taekwoon shook his head, the movement jostling against Hongbin's shoulder. \"Taekwoon.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I don't want to,\" Taekwoon complained, a little whiny. The thought of having to sit through countless meetings where no one ever said what they meant and politics was everything soured him to his core. The thought of having to attend those balls that seemed to form the pillars of Lunenthal's society was softened only by the anticipation of N's presence. His illicit presence sent a slight thrill through Taekwoon\u2014the sort that he'd had as a child, doing something forbidden by his parents.</p>\n  <p>\"You're all but recovered,\" Hongbin said. \"Tomorrow night. No excuses.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Do you think\u2014\" Taekwoon cut himself off and then sat up, rubbing at his face. \"I suppose,\" he said instead. \"I don't have a choice, do I?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Nope,\" Hongbin said. He glanced at Taekwoon sharply, but he did not comment on Taekwoon's initial words. \"Well, I suppose you'll go back to reading, won't you.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon made a face, but this time, he was the one with no comment.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>And yet, as fate would have it, it had scarce been two weeks, during which he had briefly spoken with N once, before Taekwoon was again excused from attending, this time, because he had woken one night, flush with fever. </p>\n  <p>\"You can't be doing this on purpose,\" Hongbin muttered. \"You can't.\"</p>\n  <p>\"And if I were?\" Taekwoon's voice was scratchy, and Hongbin's voice was loud. \"Go away.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Drink your tea,\" Hongbin snapped, but Taekwoon only rolled over and buried his face in his pillow.</p>\n  <p>\"Be nice to me,\" he said, his words muffled.</p>\n  <p>\"Oh for crissake's\u2014\" Hongbin turned Taekwoon back onto his back, Taekwoon too weak to resist. He was far gentler helping Taekwoon up, a hand against his back as Taekwoon sat up, however reluctant it was. There was a sleeping draught in the tea, as well as something to soothe Taekwoon's throat and help his fever, or that was what the doctor had said. Nonetheless, Taekwoon made a face at the first sip.</p>\n  <p>\"That's how you know it's good for you,\" Hongbin said. Taekwoon grimaced at him, but thankfully continued to drink it, lukewarm by now, until he'd finally finished.</p>\n  <p>\"That wasn't so hard, was it?\" Hongbin spoke as if he were speaking to a small child, something that did not go missed by Taekwoon, even in his mildly delirious state. </p>\n  <p>\"Go away,\" Taekwoon repeated.</p>\n  <p>\"Right. Well.\" Hongbin levered himself up, hands on his knees. He sighed, looking down at Taekwoon who had burrowed back into the blankets, even though his face was flushed with heat. This was a familiar scene from when Taekwoon had been younger\u2014but it had been some time since Taekwoon had last fallen ill like this, and Hongbin's worry may have been more from disuse than anything else. \"Feel better, I guess.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Go away.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon drifted in and out of sleep, waking moments blurred with restless dreams, sometimes the doctor but usually Hongbin, with some bitter concoction that would send Taekwoon slipping out of consciousness once again, only to groggily return what felt like seconds later. He felt <i>hot</i>, but every time he kicked off the blankets, it was suddenly too cold, and Taekwoon found himself clutching for them, only he could never find them. Sometimes, he woke to find the blankets pulled back up to his chin, sometimes he woke to find himself tangled in them, too hot once again, and sometimes he woke shivering, freezing. </p>\n  <p>\"I see you're at least alive.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Go away,\" Taekwoon croaked, before he registered that it was neither Hongbin, nor the doctor, that was perched at his window. Taekwoon frowned, unsure if he was awake or asleep, because he would be lying had he said that N and the cat had not featured frequently in his fever dreams.</p>\n  <p>\"I thought you might want company,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>It was dark, and the room was illuminated from outside, from the lights that framed the Keep, a show of power like so much else of it was.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't,\" Taekwoon said, a reflex. And then: \"don't go.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Alright,\" N said. </p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shuffled so he could sit up against the headboard, but he found that the room was turning upside down. Suddenly, there was a hand against his shoulder, and Taekwoon found himself leaning back against the headboard, and upright. The touch was warm, and Taekwoon leaned into it.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not a bad person,\" Taekwoon murmured. He wasn't sure where the words came from, but he knew they were true. The touch shifted, drew away, and Taekwoon clutched at it to make it stay.</p>\n  <p>\"Am I?\" N asked. Taekwoon nodded and then immediately regretted it, the room turning in all directions once again. He squeezed his eyes shut, although the room was largely dark and there was little to shut out of his vision. He became vaguely aware of N on the bed beside him, of the body of warmth next to him. </p>\n  <p>\"You truly are an interesting man,\" N said quietly.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon did not know how to reply, but he did manage to open his eyes, the world seemingly steadied. N was staring at him, his eyes ablaze, and Taekwoon found himself entranced by them.</p>\n  <p>\"You are,\" Taekwoon finally said.</p>\n  <p>This drew a small laugh from the other man, the hint of a smile, but it was not the same smile that Taekwoon had wanted to see again so badly.</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose I am,\" was the quiet reply. Silence fell, but the steadfast touch against Taekwoon's arm remained. It was warm, and slowly, it slid down until it rested against the back of Taekwoon's hand. N's eyes drifted away into the darkness, but Taekwoon's remained on him, tracing the profile shadowed by the light from outside the window. He could hear him breathing, louder than Taekwoon's own breaths, a steady, even rhythm.</p>\n  <p>The hand on the back of his pressed down, held it tighter, and Taekwoon took comfort from it. It was warm, and safe, and it was in that cocoon of safety that Taekwoon's eyes slowly closed again, heavy.</p>\n  <p>\"Don't go,\" he said again. Somewhere through the sleep haze, Taekwoon thought that he heard an \"I won't\" in reply.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon watched as the young man in front of him slowly drifted back into sleep, as his eyes closed, as his breathing evened, deep and steady. His hair was sweat plastered against his face, and his skin was still flush from fever, a fever that Hakyeon could feel from where he was gripping Leo's hand, feeling as it relaxed as Leo dropped off again into fitful rest. He was handsome, yes, even ill in bed like this, but with his eyes closed and face not set in rigid severity, that handsomeness seemed to give way to something far softer.</p>\n  <p>Slowly, Hakyeon slid a hand behind Leo's back, much as he had done earlier, only this time it was to lower him to the bed, supporting Leo's neck with his other hand. Leo stirred slightly only to turn half onto his side, reaching for Hakyeon's arm. Hakyeon stilled in surprise, but Leo's grip was weak and Hakyeon removed his hand gently, tucking Leo's arm under the blanket. His own touch lingered against the sliver of exposed skin at Leo's wrist, which not so long ago had been painted with ugly green and purple. He drew back in time, but the phantom warmth from Leo's too hot skin remained at the tip of his fingers, against the palm of his hand.</p>\n  <p>This was his target. The man who he'd been sent to kill. Asleep in front of him, ill with fever, defenceless, truly vulnerable\u2014a man who had told Hakyeon not to go, who had just told Hakyeon that he was not a bad person. Hakyeon leaned over him, placed a hand on the other side of him, the mattress sinking under his weight. The knife he always carried with him was heavy against his side as Hakyeon brushed his fingers against the man's cheek, trailing down the side of his jaw, lingering at his neck before he closed his fingers about his throat.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon, slowly, drew a finger across Leo's neck, imagining the way blood would well up in the wake of the wound, imagining Leo's aborted scream of surprise, soundless, as his voice box would be severed. His look of horror, betrayal, something too horrible for Hakyeon to even imagine. Hakyeon sank to his knees by the bed, pressing his forehead against the side of it, burying his face in the sheets. His hand lingered on Leo's chest, over his heart, over the steady beat of life, however faint it was through the blankets. Like the cat, only stronger, firmer, more rhythmic. </p>\n  <p>It was many, many heartbeats later before Hakyeon drew himself to his feet. A flash of a memory as he looked down at him\u2014the radiant smile as Leo had looked up from the cat, open, unabashed\u2014</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon hurried to the window, and shutting it behind him, disappeared into the night.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan was waiting for him when he returned. Hakyeon pulled up short when he saw Jaehwan's silhouette, standing outside, far up from the door, far enough that he would have been able to see Hakyeon, no matter how he intended to enter Hyuk's home.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not sleeping,\" Hakyeon said. He walked towards Jaehwan, and then past him, but Jaehwan snagged his arm and pulled him about.</p>\n  <p>\"Where were you?\" Jaehwan asked. His eyes flashed, perhaps in anger, and Hakyeon shook off his grip.</p>\n  <p>\"That's my business, not yours,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"It's my business if it's going to endanger the job,\" Jaehwan said, and it was definitely anger there, Jaehwan's already short temper having reached its limit. Hakyeon stared at him, silent, before he turned on his heel and continued walking towards the house.</p>\n  <p>\"Hakyeon\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I'm going to bed,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Don't just\u2014Hakyeon!\"</p>\n  <p>Blast it all, Hakyeon thought as he scaled the wall to the window, the same way he\u2019d left. Blast it all.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"You don't mind, do you?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon looked up, only to see that N had appeared in the seat next to him. He blinked, and then put down his book. \"You,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, me.\" N smiled at him and Taekwoon twitched, suddenly remembering why the man had so irritated the first time he'd seen him.</p>\n  <p>\"You're here,\" Taekwoon said, and even he thought it was rather redundant, although he made no motion to acknowledge it. This was greeted with a slight tilt of N's head, and another quirk of a smile.</p>\n  <p>\"You do look better,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned at him.</p>\n  <p>\"Like you might be waiting for a lady friend again,\" N clarified, \"although I suppose I should be the one to comment on your presence, no? You have missed several of these...things, lately.\" He accompanied the word with a small gesture of his hand.</p>\n  <p>\"I was ill,\" Taekwoon said. He watched for any reaction, but the only one he got was the same unwavering smile that he was used to by now. \"Although you knew that.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I did hear,\" N said, \"but you can't believe everything you hear.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon frowned, unsure. </p>\n  <p>\"Oh, did you hear\u2014well, it seems that your attendant may owe someone an apology,\" N said. Taekwoon's confusion must have been plain on his face, because it was N's turn to frown. \"The Soliarians?\"</p>\n  <p>It took Taekwoon several moments before he understood what N was speaking of. \"Oh,\" he said. There wasn't much else to say.</p>\n  <p>\"You don't seem surprised,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>\"You didn't seem to think it was them,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"And yet you said nothing to your attendant,\" N said.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon shrugged. \"I could not be sure,\" he said. \"Would my word have been enough?\"</p>\n  <p>\"You underestimate the power you hold,\" N said softly. \"You are in a unique position of being the sole remaining heir to the Azure Seat of the Dragon\u2014did you never wonder why you were the one who was targeted?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon stilled for long moments, before he shook his head. \"No,\" he admitted.</p>\n  <p>\"And did you really think that it would be advantageous to the Soliarians to invite war, just when they had managed to broker some trade deals that would benefit them? When they are militaristically so much weaker?\" N asked.</p>\n  <p>Another shake of his head. </p>\n  <p>\"Ah, so you did not consider these things at all,\" N said mildly. \"And you seem unaware of the power you truly hold, and yet you hide behind it to tuck yourself away in such places, leaving your attendant to perform your job.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon stiffened, stared at the man. \"What are you trying to say?\" he asked. </p>\n  <p>N shrugged, a mirror of the damningly infuriating man that Taekwoon had first met. \"Nothing at all, beyond what I am saying,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't believe you.\"</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose you don't have a choice.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon narrowed his eyes at him, but suddenly the man laughed, a slight chuckle that had the corners of his eyes crinkling. </p>\n  <p>\"Oh, you should have seen your face,\" N said. \"I had wondered where the young lord I had first met had gone.\"</p>\n  <p>\"What?\" The word was out of Taekwoon's mouth before his brain had had a chance to catch up, and his brows were furrowed as he regarded N, whose eyes were still curled in laughter. </p>\n  <p>\"Nothing,\" N said, in the way that children would say the word, hiding the sweets they'd stolen behind their backs. Taekwoon's mouth twisted into a petulant scowl.</p>\n  <p>\"You can't say that,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>\"Can't I?\"</p>\n  <p>\"It's...\" Taekwoon pressed his lips together as he stared at N, who simply grinned brightly back at him.</p>\n  <p>\"Well, Lord Leo, it was nice speaking to you.\" N stood, smiling at him, utterly unperturbed.</p>\n  <p>\"You're leaving?\" Taekwoon asked.</p>\n  <p>\"I am a busy man,\" N said, and his words sent a jolt through Taekwoon as he recalled that this man in front of him was a murderer. \"As you should be. I suppose I shall see you soon?\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon blinked, once. \"Yes,\" he said, and then N had bowed, leaving Taekwoon to stare at his retreating back. He stared at it for several long seconds before picking up his book again. N had disappeared into the crowd, and Taekwoon found himself quite unable to focus on the study of rhetoric. He checked his watch, sighed, and left to find Hongbin.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"Hakyeon.\"</p>\n  <p>It was Jaehwan, but there was no one else it could have been. Wonsik had long since given up, and Hyuk had declared from the start that their problems were not his problems. Hakyeon stared steadfastly forward, to where the cat leapt for the stick tied at the end of the willow branch in Hakyeon's hand. It twisted as it leapt, the stick caught momentarily between its paws before Hakyeon jerked at the rod, and the stick bounced up with it.</p>\n  <p>\"He's having fun,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>\"He?\"</p>\n  <p>\"The cat,\" Hakyeon said. He'd taken to calling him Leo when they were alone, but that was something he would never admit to Jaehwan. It seemed a fitting name for a cat. </p>\n  <p>\"Hakyeon,\" Jaehwan said again.</p>\n  <p>\"You'll wear it out like that,\" Hakyeon said. \"My name.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You'll just make yourself a new one.\"</p>\n  <p>\"A new name?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed quietly, dangling the stick low in front of the cat, but Leo had had enough and stalked off to the other end of the yard to wash his face. \"It doesn't work that way,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Then how does it work?\"</p>\n  <p>\"A mask,\" Hakyeon said. \"A very good mask. A good mask is difficult to make, but it can be done. But your true self\u2014that, you can never make a new one of. Why we protect them so closely\u2014knowing someone\u2019s true self gives one power over them.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan hopped onto the fence on which Hakyeon sat, a good distance apart. Hakyeon could feel Jaehwan's eyes on him, but he had eyes only for the cat.</p>\n  <p>\"We don't have time,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n  <p>\"Mmm.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hakyeon, you <i>can't</i> keep putting this off\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know.\" Hakyeon let the toy fall to the ground, the wooden branches falling without a sound as they landed in the dirt.</p>\n  <p>\"Then\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know,\" Hakyeon said again. He paused. \"Jaehwan.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Huh?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Who are you?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Wha\u2014Huh? What are you talking about? I'm Jae\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Hakyeon said, cutting Jaehwan and his rambling off. \"Who are you?\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan stilled beside him, and Hakyeon knew that his friend had caught the meaning underneath his words. There was the space of several breaths, before Jaehwan answered without an answer to the question at all.</p>\n  <p>\"You think you've become your mask,\" Jaehwan said quietly.</p>\n  <p>\"Do I?\" Hakyeon said. He let his voice lilt up at the end, a question of skepticism, rather than a question of inquiry. Carefully placed, carefully chosen, a performance to the end. He had always loved to perform, as a child. Hakyeon smiled softly, bitterly to himself. \"You were not a happy child.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan froze, stilled in surprise. A flare of anger, a flash of memories he did his best to bury. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" </p>\n  <p>\"Nothing. Everything.\" </p>\n  <p>\"Damn it, Hakyeon\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I know. It's time.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Will you stop cutting me off?\" Jaehwan growled.</p>\n  <p>\"I will if you stop saying such inane things,\" Hakyeon said, voice easy. \"If you keep insisting on telling me things I already know.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Well you're not acting like you know! You have to kill the guy, you have to kill the <i>target</i>, Hakyeon, I swear\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"What did I say?\" Hakyeon spoke over him, but Jaehwan had whirled on Hakyeon now, even though Hakyeon would not look at him.</p>\n  <p>\"I should have stopped you\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"The Dragon Keep is finally hosting an event soon.\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon's words, soft though they were, silenced Jaehwan more effectively than any harsh tone that Hakyeon could've taken. He didn't need to turn to know that the colour of Jaehwan's gaze had changed.</p>\n  <p>\"That's in three days,\" Jaehwan murmured.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, harsh and biting. \"I know,\" he said, like he'd already said far too many times. Yet, what else could he say, when Jaehwan insisted on repeating things that Hakyeon did, in fact, know.</p>\n  <p>\"Oriton,\" Hakyeon said. \"Do you remember?\"</p>\n  <p>Beside him, Jaehwan frowned, face scrunched up in thought. It had been many years ago now, four, nearly five.  A painful death, a drawn out one. One of the very first they had undertaken. Perhaps that was why Hakyeon recalled it so vividly.</p>\n  <p>\"Aconite,\" Hakyeon said, and when he glanced at Jaehwan, realisation had dawned across his expression. It had been Jaehwan, after all, who had suggested the plant, had pointed out the bright purple flowers, had reminded Hakyeon about the poison in its roots. Hakyeon opened his hand, the fist he'd kept clenched by his side all this time, revealing instead a handful of nut-hard berries, bright red, against his palm. He looked at Jaehwan\u2014this time, a look loaded with meaning. </p>\n  <p>\"You mean to mix them,\" Jaehwan said, looking at the abrus eye berries Hakyeon held. \"As they did.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You are smarter than you appear,\" Hakyeon said, taking on an amused tone. Yet, Jaehwan did not rise to the bait, and Hakyeon sighed, both inwardly and outwardly. \"But, yes, you're right. It would be fitting, wouldn't it\u2014the heir to the Seat of the Dragon perishing the same way any who might have inherited the Seat of the Tiger had perished all those years ago?\"</p>\n  <p>\"But that's too obvious,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n  <p>\"Of course. Just as it is too obvious for it to have been perpetrated by the Onyx Seat, no?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Who's supposed to have done it then?\"</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, the same harsh laugh from before. \"Does it matter?\" he asked.</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Jaehwan murmured. \"I suppose not. They'll say the other one did it, because they didn't. I mean, they didn't, but the other one also didn't do it. Black against white, huh?\"</p>\n  <p>\"It is one of my more clever ideas,\" Hakyeon said, but he couldn't quite manage to fill it with enough self-confident arrogance as he would have liked. Jaehwan, for once, did not acknowledge it.</p>\n  <p>Leo\u2014the cat, Leo\u2014had long since finished cleaning its face, and had stretched out in a patch of sun, ostensibly asleep but for the occasional slow blink of its eyes, bright and golden.</p>\n  <p>\"You're not going to do it,\" Jaehwan said, and it wasn't as much of a question as it ought to have been.</p>\n  <p>\"No, I am,\" Hakyeon said. He slipped his hand into his pocket, brushing against the small, glass bottle there.</p>\n  <p>\"Will you?\"</p>\n  <p>For the third time, Hakyeon laughed a laugh without any mirth at all. \"No, I will. But whether or not...well,\" Hakyeon said slowly, \"some things are better left to chance.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>It was a rare occasion for the Seat of the Dragon to host such a party\u2014for like that of the Phoenix, its power and place among the Cardinal Four had always been indubitable. Yet, like any of the Seats and Manors, it too took its turn in the never-ending cycle, like the orbit of a comet at its peak and its wane, the brief moment when it finally returned near that which it circled.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon had never been inside.</p>\n  <p>He'd had Jaehwan describe it to him, but Jaehwan had never been in the great hall, and so he could not have described the grand wooden pillars, the carved reliefs in aged trunks of ancient trees, the twining of long dead branches about sturdy, steel columns, painted over with burnished brass. Jaehwan had told him about the sitting room, about the side doors, about the halls that led to what he believed were the servants' stairs, but he had not told him about the domed ceiling, about the gilded walls, about how evident that this was an old keep, an old hall, one that had stood the test of time, and would continue to stand the test of time, supported even as it was by something so impermanent. It was a show of power, yes, but a show of power past and future; not merely of the present. </p>\n  <p>Hakyeon lingered at the edge for several long moments, even as Jaehwan shifted impatiently beside him. This was not a place where Hakyeon belonged. He could play the part and he could play the part well, but he had not been born to these sleek uniforms, to the courting of silk and satin, to the gentle strains of music that Hakyeon loved, yet could never grow used to. He could make the right conversations, he could say the right things, he could affect the proper expressions, the proper reactions, and yet.</p>\n  <p>\"Go,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded. \"Remember what we discussed,\" he said. He'd barely taken a step, however, before Jaehwan spoke quietly behind him.</p>\n  <p>\"Will you really be able to?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n  <p>\"I suppose we'll have to see,\" Hakyeon said. His eyes closed for a brief moment, and when they opened, he had shoved his feelings away and placed a small smile on his face.</p>\n  <p>He found Leo easily enough. Perhaps it was better to say that it would have been strange not to have found him. The Dragon Lord, his father, was the most eye-catching, but Leo had still drawn enough of a cluster to be fair noticeable. There was a young woman next to him in a fetching red dress, and from her looks, Hakyeon guessed that this was one of Leo's sisters.</p>\n  <p>Leo caught his eye through the people\u2014Hakyeon could tell, because there was the slightest hitch in his expression, a brief flash of surprise, but no other acknowledgement. Hakyeon ought to have been thankful, and yet, an odd pit of disappointment gathered at the base of his stomach. It took some time for Hakyeon to drift towards him, and Hakyeon lost track of the number of small, inane conversations he had, spelling lie after lie until they may as well have formed their own truth.</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, my lord. My lady.\" Hakyeon, finally, found himself in front of Leo, and he bowed deeply, respectfully, as much as he dared to go, before repeating the motion to Leo's sister. Leo was squinting at him as he straightened, eyes narrowed ever so slightly. \"It is a great honour to meet you,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>A young lady near him made a small sound of impatience. Hakyeon gave her a pleasant smile, as pleasant as he could manage. He supposed she was comely enough, and he suspected she was of high rank, for her to dare to be so open in front of the heir to the Azure Seat.</p>\n  <p>\"Be welcome,\" Leo said. The words ought to have been stiff, yet they seemed to come naturally, and Hakyeon swallowed. There wasn't a hint in the exchange that might have implied that they had ever spoken. Dangerous, perhaps, for it was hard to say who might have seen them together, yet perhaps the safest for them both. </p>\n  <p>\"I merely wished to express my regards,\" Hakyeon said, speaking to Leo, although he glanced sideways at the young lady. Her dress was ridiculous, he thought sourly to himself. \"Although I suppose that you are a busy man.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Not so busy,\" Leo said, quiet. Yet he nodded a dismissal, and Hakyeon withdrew. </p>\n  <p>He looked so <i>natural</i>\u2014the realisation struck Hakyeon like one of Jaehwan's punches. Hakyeon had never seen him like this, had never seen how much he belonged in such a place, surrounded by people who wished for his favour, just as Leo had assumed Hakyeon had wanted. Hakyeon wanted far more than that, but it was something Leo was never to know\u2014or perhaps it was better to say that he would know all too soon. He was used to seeing Leo hiding away from his responsibilities, shirking his duties, but here he was, performing them so admirably that one could never have guessed his sharp dislike for such things.</p>\n  <p>\"We all have our places in the world,\" Hakyeon murmured quietly to himself. Just as Leo's was to rule, just as beasts were to be eaten, just as Hakyeon's was to be a murderer. In Leo's words.</p>\n  <p>He turned sharply on his heel, no longer caring about being unnoticeable. He would wait. Wait and hide. Until the guests had all gone, until Leo had returned to his chambers, until night had fallen and Leo's anguished screams would echo through the Keep the loudest. </p>\n  <p>And yet, as he tucked himself behind a pillar, steadying his breaths, it was the sound of harried footsteps, familiar footsteps, that approached. Hakyeon froze, still, unsure, and those five seconds of hesitation took the choice away from him.</p>\n  <p>\"You're here.\"</p>\n  <p>Suddenly, Leo stood in front of him, and Hakyeon could not school his features into an appropriate expression fast enough, could not hide his moment of unintended delight at the small quirk of pleasure playing in Leo's eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"As you well know,\" Hakyeon said. \"We did speak earlier, did we not?\"</p>\n  <p>\"No,\" Leo said, grimacing a little in irritation, \"I mean, you're <i>here</i>.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, you mean in this very spot? You're quite correct, as usual,\" Hakyeon said, purposely infuriating, and yet, Leo seemed not to rise to the bait. \"How did you escape?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ah.\" A slight flush crept at the tips of Leo's ears. \"I said I had need of a private moment.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Of course,\" Hakyeon said. \"You are human after all, however much this might imply otherwise.\" He nodded towards the hall, encompassing the decorations, the people, and Leo's place in it all. It only seemed to fluster Leo further.</p>\n  <p>\"I have to go,\" Leo said. \"But...\"</p>\n  <p>\"Do finish your sentences,\" Hakyeon said. \"It's very difficult to gather what you mean.\"</p>\n  <p>Finally, this netted Hakyeon a truly irritated scowl but it fell away far too quickly to be satisfying.</p>\n  <p>\"I...\" Leo paused, and his eyes shifted away from Hakyeon. Hakyeon waited, giving him space, giving him time. \"I like talking to you,\" he finally said. \"But there's nowhere to talk here. Can...my room?\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ah.\" Hakyeon blinked, smoothing down his heartbeat as best as he could, slipping a smile onto his face as best as he could. \"Are you not afraid for your virtue?\"</p>\n  <p>This time, Leo's ears turned bright pink, and Hakyeon couldn't quite hide a genuine smile. \"Third floor,\" Leo said. \"If you go to that door in the back, and then\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I believe I'll be able to find it,\" Hakyeon said, cutting him off. \"Maybe you don't remember, but I've...\"</p>\n  <p>It was Hakyeon's turn to trail off, unable to finish the sentence in its entirety. He watched Leo, unsure if he did remember, and if he hadn't, if it would jog his memory, and if it did\u2014</p>\n  <p>\"So it wasn't a dream,\" Leo said quietly.</p>\n  <p>\"It is what you make of it,\" Hakyeon said. He inclined his head behind him, just a bit. \"Perhaps you should go back.\"</p>\n  <p>Leo nodded. \"I'll say I need to rest, later. My sister can take my place. She...used to do it a lot.\" A small smile played about Leo's lips, a memory, some sort of amusement that he felt like he did not need to conceal from Hakyeon. Hakyeon could acknowledge it as guilt, this feeling in his chest, this constriction, this sharp prickling like a bramble's thorns.</p>\n  <p>\"Then I will find you when you do,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>Leo nodded again, several small quick nods. A slight purse of his lips and then he was gone, leaving Hakyeon with a pounding heart and legs which seemed to no longer be able to hold his weight.</p>\n  <p>The stars were aligned, or so the saying went. Far too perfectly aligned.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\"We're moving things up,\" Hakyeon said quietly to Jaehwan. To anyone watching, it would be an innocuous conversation\u2014some member of a low ranked House conveying instructions to an attendant.</p>\n  <p>\"What?\" Jaehwan pulled back and frowned.</p>\n  <p>\"He's planning on returning to his room,\" Hakyeon said. He saw the catch of surprise in Jaehwan's eyes\u2014it would have been hard to miss.</p>\n  <p>\"How do you know?\" Jaehwan asked.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon's smile was grim, if it could be called a smile. \"He told me,\" he said. \"He told me to meet him there.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan's expression could only be labelled as incredulity. \"He really does trust you,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>\"Unfortunately.\" The word was out of Hakyeon's mouth before he could stop it, and it instantly drew a dark veil over Jaehwan's face. Hakyeon quickly shook his head. He'd seen Wonsik earlier in the peripheral of his vision, dressed as a simple server. He would be present if needed.</p>\n  <p>\"I need you to keep an eye on the target's attendant,\" Hakyeon said, low and urgent. He had no clue where Hongbin was, and it worried him.</p>\n  <p>\"As always,\" Jaehwan said, the verbal equivalent of rolling his eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, well keep a better eye on him than usual,\" Hakyeon said. \"The target may trust me, but that man...\"</p>\n  <p>\"Is very good at his job,\" Jaehwan finished for him. He nodded to somewhere behind Hakyeon. \"That's your cue.\"</p>\n  <p>Leo had detached himself from the retinue and was withdrawing\u2014not through the door that he had indicated to Hakyeon, but through another, far finer. So he knew that Hakyeon was not to be seen.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes,\" Hakyeon said quietly. \"Find Wonsik. Send him after me. I doubt I will need him, but it'll be the smarter choice.\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan took a step back and then sketched a bow to Hakyeon, form perfect. \"Yes, my lord,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon nodded at him, a dismissal much like Leo had given him earlier. He watched as Jaehwan left, hopefully to seek out Hongbin, and prayed to the heavens above that all would go to plan. If that was how the whole praying thing worked\u2014he'd never done it before.</p>\n  <p>He let the smallest hand of the clock travel about several rounds, the knife buckled inside his jacket a terrible weight. The glass bottle in his pocket was warm to the touch and Hakyeon could only hope that there was enough in it, and that it had been done right. Too much hinged on it, and this night would end very differently depending on the contents of this bottle. Hakyeon crossed his arms over his chest, letting his hands grip against his forearms, reassuring himself that the blades there were still strapped in well. Wonsik called him old fashioned, but Wonsik could keep his guns to himself\u2014Hakyeon would keep his knives until the day he died.</p>\n  <p>The room seemed to fade away as Hakyeon slipped about its edges, the decorations blurring into every room that Hakyeon had ever been in, the people disappearing into an indistinguishable crowd. He waited a breath, and then another, and in the third\u2014once he was sure that he would not be seen\u2014he slipped through the door that Leo had indicated, and felt like his heart would burst.</p>\n  <p>These were not the servants' stairs. Hakyeon took quick stock of his surroundings. The steps were stone, the railings burnished steel. There was another door opposite the one he had come through, wooden and plain. The stairs up were to his left\u2014there were no stairs to the cellar here, although the Keep must have had one. Perhaps through the other door\u2014Hakyeon suspected it led to the servants' quarters. He sketched a quick layout of the place in his mind, placing what he knew and what Jaehwan had indicated to him onto one mental map.</p>\n  <p>The third floor, Leo had said, and Hakyeon remembered it well enough, at least from the outside. The Dragon's Keep was of a multi faceted design: twelve uneven sides forming an elongated sort of building. The hall was to one side, and from the placement of the doors, Hakyeon knew that he was at the back of the Keep. Leo's chambers were about halfway down, smaller than Hakyeon had expected, far more suited to a young child than the heir to the Seat. He would have to depend on all the activity in the Keep to be drawn to the ground floor\u2014there would be very little space to hide. A small part of Hakyeon reminded him that he had a right to be here, that Leo had invited him up, and that were he to encounter someone, it would be enough to mention the purpose of his presence, and it could be confirmed soon enough by Leo himself. And yet.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon removed the brooch about his throat, loosened his sleeves, unbuttoned his jacket, discarding the brooch in a small alcove behind the door. It no longer mattered how he appeared\u2014any witnesses would have to be eliminated, and how effectively he could eliminate them was far more important. Hakyeon sank into himself, a calming breath even as his heart raced in an unfamiliar pattern. The sound of life was overwhelming from the other side of the door, and there was no movement that Hakyeon could hear from above. </p>\n  <p>The stairs opened into a hallway on the second floor and Hakyeon paused, unwilling to step beyond. Just as the Onyx Keep favoured dark stone and the Crimson Keep preferred walls and floors burnished with red, the Dragon's Keep had floors and walls of pale blue tinted stone. It felt too airy, too untouched for Hakyeon's taste, even knowing as he did that there was nothing pure about any part of this city, let alone this Keep. </p>\n  <p>The stairs continued to his right, but before Hakyeon had a chance to slip towards them, there was the quick sound of footsteps, too familiar to be of comfort, and Hakyeon swore.</p>\n  <p>\"You\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"Yes, me.\" Hakyeon stepped fully into the light to face Hongbin. \"You and your master both seem to have an affinity for stating the obvious.\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin was a cold ball of fury in front of him. His hand had gone to the hilt of his sword, the one he carried as was his right as Leo's attendant. Hakyeon looked at it, looked at Hongbin, and then looked at the stairs that continued upwards, to where Leo's chambers were.</p>\n  <p>\"I don't want to fight you,\" Hakyeon said mildly. \"My business isn't with you.\"</p>\n  <p>\"His business is my business,\" Hongbin snarled.</p>\n  <p>\"I really don't want to kill you,\" Hakyeon said. Nonetheless, he felt the weight of his knives reassuring against his arms.</p>\n  <p>\"You'll have to if you want to get to him,\" Hongbin said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon inclined his head, an acknowledgement of his words. \"Then you leave me with no choice,\" he said, and launched himself at Hongbin, snatching his knives from their sheaths as he did. Hongbin didn't flinch in the slightest, merely pulled out his own blade, easily countering both of Hakyeon's blows. Hakyeon danced back, out of Hongbin's considerably longer range. Blast it, what had Jaehwan been doing? </p>\n  <p>They watched each other warily, and Hakyeon knew that he had the advantage that Hongbin was unused to fighting for his life, merely only ever for play. Yet he suspected that would not be much of an advantage here, not with this man. He also doubted that he would truly be able to kill the man for the same reason he would never have been able to have killed Leo at first blow. There was real fear in Hongbin's eyes, but there was also desperation and fire and defiance and the true willingness to lay down his life.</p>\n  <p>He hoped it would not come to that.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon made the first move\u2014a feint forward, a step to the right. Hongbin fell for neither, lunging straight for Hakyeon, following it with a quick cut to the side that Hakyeon dodged, only for Hongbin to catch Hakyeon in the chest with his elbow. Hakyeon cursed silently, chest heaving with a need for air as he jumped back, putting space between them. Hakyeon was by no means short, but Hongbin was damned tall and Hakyeon's usual advantage of height was suddenly his disadvantage.</p>\n  <p>But there was no time. The sound of metal scraping against metal was the only warning Hakyeon got, his knife coming up before his mind caught up, Hongbin suddenly there, in front of him. Hakyeon snarled, shoving him off and ducking low, cutting under Hongbin's guard. The man swore as Hakyeon's blade caught at his leg, just enough to draw first blood. Hakyeon pulled back, far back, knowing it was too dangerous to push a man like Hongbin. The two of them faced each other, Hongbin breathing lightly, Hakyeon still trying to regain his breath from Hongbin's earlier blow.</p>\n  <p>Footsteps pounded up the stairs, two sets, and Hakyeon pivoted sharply, Hongbin doing the same. Friend or foe\u2014relief or worse.</p>\n  <p>\"You're here!\" Jaehwan burst into view, followed shortly by Wonsik.</p>\n  <p>\"Yes I am,\" Hakyeon snapped. \"And so is <i>he</i>. What in hell were you doing?\"</p>\n  <p>\"I lost him, alright?\" Jaehwan bared his teeth in irritation, but there were more pressing matters at hand. Jaehwan and Wonsik joined Hakyeon, flanking him on either side, spanning the width of the hall, facing Hongbin's solitary one. The fear was real now, but just as the fear grew, so did the fire.</p>\n  <p>\"So there was a third one,\" Hongbin said. His eyes flickered briefly over Jaehwan to land on Wonsik, who merely shrugged and unholstered his gun. </p>\n  <p>\"Don't know how much use I'll be\u2014don't bring a gun to a knife fight, that still holds when you guys have swords, right?\"</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan snorted, unsheathing his own blade. \"Just don't shoot me and we'll be fine.\" He turned to Hakyeon. \"Go! Before he gets tired of waiting!\"</p>\n  <p>Hongbin cursed as he darted forward to block Hakyeon's path, but Jaehwan was closer and Hongbin's blade slid harmlessly off of Jaehwan's, even as Hakyeon ducked past Jaehwan to head up the stairs.</p>\n  <p>\"Don't kill him,\" Hakyeon hissed as he pulled past. \"Stop him, but don't kill him.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Picky,\" Jaehwan muttered, but it was enough for Hakyeon to know that he'd heard. Enough for Hakyeon to bolt up the stairs with disregard, sheathing his blades as he did, the one still painted faintly with Hongbin's blood. </p>\n  <p>Hakyeon slowed at the last few steps. He tugged at his sleeves, buttoned his jacket. It would have to do. He walked with quick steps down the hall, still able to hear the faint sound of clashing metal behind him\u2014there were no engines here to disguise the sound.</p>\n  <p>He encountered no one, a small mercy, and it was with far too quick a heartbeat that he stopped in front of Leo's door. Hakyeon thought of knocking\u2014he grabbed the handle instead, the door swinging open easily when he twisted.</p>\n  <p>Leo was pacing uneasily inside, and when the door opened, he looked up, frozen, startled, before a small smile slipped unbidden onto his face.</p>\n  <p>\"You came,\" he said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon snorted. \"Yes, I appear to have,\" he said. He shut the door behind him, and it seemed too ominous a sound.</p>\n  <p>\"I...wasn't sure,\" Leo said slowly, his eyes flickering away. \"Perhaps it was too much of a request.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Ah, were you thinking of more than simply...talking?\" Hakyeon asked. <i>Oh child</i>, he wanted to say. He laughed instead, a small chuckle, a sound to fill the space rather than to convey amusement. \"And to think that you said you would never enjoy my company.\"</p>\n  <p>\"You're interesting,\" Leo said shortly. He still wasn't looking at Hakyeon and his ears had turned a bright red.</p>\n  <p>\"And that is enough?\" Hakyeon asked.</p>\n  <p>He took a step forward, but Leo had yet to meet his eyes, his gaze still directed off to the side like a bashful child. Like\u2014</p>\n  <p>The realisation stopped Hakyeon in his tracks, a jagged dagger piercing through his chest and down to his gut. It twisted inside of him, the feeling sickening, nauseating, and Hakyeon found it suddenly difficult to breathe as he stared at the man in front of him\u2014the target, the <i>target</i>\u2014and the soft set of his lips, his eyes, his jaw.</p>\n  <p>Blast it all.</p>\n  <p>He closed the space between them in three quick steps and Leo looked up in surprise just in time for Hakyeon to catch his eyes widening before he pulled Leo to his chest, wrapping his arms about his waist, so warm, so sturdy. He pressed his hands flat against Leo's back, memorising the ridge of his shoulder blade, the dip in the small of his back. Leo was stiff in his embrace but he relaxed far too soon, far too willing to believe this lie that Hakyeon was presenting.</p>\n  <p>\"I really wasn't dreaming,\" Leo said. His words were so soft and they brushed against the shell of Hakyeon's ear so near that it struck Hakyeon to his core.</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps you'll wish you had,\" Hakyeon said. He drew back slightly, meeting Leo's eyes. His hand came to rest on Leo's arm, and he gripped him, a shaking grasp.</p>\n  <p>\"Why would\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"I am sorry,\" Hakyeon said. Confusion was evident on Leo's face, but it was a confusion that Hakyeon could not himself face. In one quick motion, he drew the knife from within his jacket and crushed Leo to him again.</p>\n  <p>\"You hold power, which makes you a powerful pawn,\" Hakyeon said\u2014and slid the dagger into the space between Leo's ribs in one swift thrust.</p>\n  <p>It was done.</p>\n  <p>He stepped back, pulling the dagger out as he did so. Horror\u2014no, something worse than that\u2014filled Leo's eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"My blade goes to the highest bidder,\" Hakyeon said softly. \"But they are not your enemies\u2014you have only ever been a means to the end.\"</p>\n  <p>The poison would act soon enough, but Hakyeon knew that at this moment, Leo's silence came not from the poison coated on the blade, but from within himself. \"You were right. I did want something from you after all.\"</p>\n  <p>\"My life,\" Leo said. His voice was already harsh, strained. Hakyeon inclined his head in agreement.</p>\n  <p>\"Life is fragile\u2014which makes you precious and treasured,\" Hakyeon said. He left before he could see Leo drop to the floor, the poison taking hold, but nothing could block out the screams as it filled Leo\u2019s veins like fire.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon ran. He slipped, crashing down the stairs, leg colliding painfully with the stone edge. His arm scraped against the railing, gashing it open, but Hakyeon ignored it as he turned the corner, all but throwing himself down the last flight. </p>\n  <p>Hongbin's look was one of pure horror.</p>\n  <p>\"No\u2014\" </p>\n  <p>He lunged for Hakyeon, but he was bloody and bruised from Jaehwan and Wonsik, and it was all too easy a task for Hakyeon to grab him, clutch at his arms, stare into his fast reddening eyes.</p>\n  <p>\"Listen to me,\" Hakyeon said urgently. He pressed the glass vial into Hongbin's hand. \"Go. He's in his room. Now! His life depends on it!\"</p>\n  <p>\"What are you\u2014\"</p>\n  <p>\"It's a mix of aconite and abrus eye, if this isn't enough\u2014go now, if you love him as much as you do!\" Hakyeon turned Hongbin about, pushed him towards the stairs, and finally, <i>finally</i> the man seemed to come to his senses, all but flying towards the room that Hakyeon had just left, towards Leo's horrible, horrible screams.</p>\n  <p>Jaehwan and Wonsik were both staring at him.</p>\n  <p>\"We're done,\" Hakyeon said. \"There's nothing more for us to do here.\"</p>\n  <p>\"Hakyeon...\"</p>\n  <p>\"Some things are better left to chance,\" Hakyeon said.</p>\n  <p>Wonsik's eyes were too sharp on him, and Jaehwan's too pitying. Hakyeon pressed his lips together, then turned to stride down the hallway. \"People will come soon,\" he said. \"It's time for us to disappear.\"</p>\n  <p>\"As we always do,\" Wonsik said.</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps we should disappear for longer this time,\" Jaehwan said.</p>\n  <p>Hakyeon laughed, short and bitter. Leo's screams rang loud through the building, and Hakyeon wanted nothing more than to block them out, to cover his ears and hide in a corner as a child might.</p>\n  <p>\"Perhaps, this time, for good,\" he said\u2014and then they were gone, leaving behind months of work to the hand of fate, and a piece of Hakyeon too shattered to name.</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n    <p>\u2619\u2694\u2767</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>Winter blew in chill and stark, although without leaves to lose their colour and fall away there was little visible change beyond the silver frost in the mornings, the clouding of windows, the late rising of the sun, the early onset of darkness.</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon slipped into his room, latching the door shut behind him. The scar on his back ached, fine and thin though it was. It had been a near miss, the doctors had said. Half a touch to either side and the cut would have been fatal, regardless of his narrow escape from the poison. A great stroke of luck\u2014a great touch of skill.</p>\n  <p>\"I see you're at least alive.\"</p>\n  <p>Taekwoon turned slowly. He was lounging in the chair closest to the fire, hands folded in his lap, legs crossed, perfectly at ease. A small smile played at the corners of his mouth, especially as he stood, unfolding lanky limbs with all the grace of the cat.</p>\n  <p>\"You said your blade went to the highest bidder,\" Taekwoon said.</p>\n  <p>The smile flickered wide only to disappear, leaving behind the truest sincerity that Taekwoon had ever seen on this man's face.</p>\n  <p>\"There are some things more valuable than gold,\" the man said. He said this quietly, meaningfully, and his eyes never once wavered from Taekwoon's as he spoke. He stepped forward and Taekwoon twitched, but he did not move away, not even as the man had drawn so close that were he so inclined, he could again wrap his arms about Taekwoon, only to slide a blade into his back.</p>\n  <p>\"You could at least ask my name,\" the man said, and the words skimmed against Taekwoon's cheek, followed by the soft brush of lips. \"It's Hakyeon, by the way. What's yours?\"</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n    <p>(.fin)</p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n</div></div>\n        <!-- end cache -->\n    </div>\n<!--/chapter-->\n\n    <!--afterword-->\n    <div class=\"afterword preface group\">\n        <!--work endnotes-->\n<div id=\"work_endnotes\" class=\"end notes module\">\n  <h3 class=\"heading\">Notes:</h3>\n  <blockquote class=\"userstuff\"><p>acknowledgements: influence from mistborn vol 1 (although it grew diluted as the story developed), many thanks to my dearest chingu and z for being sounding boards (many apologies to chingu for the breaking of suho's knees, despite bowing to your suggestion of making! taekwoon! sick! hmph), chingu for helping me fill out so much of this fic in terms of the world, jmm for getting me started as always despite not knowing a thing about vixx, shout out to everyone who kept me company writing, and thank you so much to tumblr user @hurtlucker for the beta despite the length!</p><p>happy holidays! i had a lot of fun writing this, and i hope that this...counts as a happy ending!</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>  <small></small><b>additional notes:</b><br />the city's structure was blatantly based off of the chinese 'four symbols' (although white-&gt;silver, black-&gt;onyx for word aesthetic reasons), and the chinese constellation system (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_constellations\" rel=\"nofollow\">x</a>). which zodiac animals (again, some had to be replaced) were associated with which divine beast was arbitrary. constellations (\u661f\u5ea7) can be literally translated as 'star seat', where as an older name \u661f\u5bbf can refer to them as 'mansions'. hence why they're 'seats', 'mansions', and 'houses' (because, well.) i did agonise a lot over this... similarly, all of the cities/states had names related to the sky... in case this wasn't obvious, ha...

It suited him.</p><p>The Akito that Toya had first met was brusque and a little rough around the edges, but the Akito that ran the flower shop was warm and polite and all smiles and meeting <i>that</i> Akito for the first time had been like meeting a stranger all over again. Toya envied him.</p><p>He wore a cap outside. Akito had snidely suggested dyeing his hair if he was so worried about it; and then he'd relented, reassuring him that it wasn't necessary. That he was safe. It didn't stop Toya from taking precautions.</p><p>He wasn't <i>scared</i>. Not for himself, at least. But after everything Akito had done for him, the guilt that he, Toya, could be the reason for destroying this idyllic life that the other man had carved out for himself\u2013that, Toya couldn't handle.</p><p>A florist with connections, Toya had called him, all those months ago. Not knowing what those connections were was best for them all.</p><p>Akito was out when the woman came. It was a warm day, the sun slipping in and out of the clouds. Toya was debating stepping outside for a moment when the door opened.</p><p>\"Welcome,\" Toya said.</p><p>She had short brown hair and an intense gaze that sized him up so quickly it made him uncomfortable. She was fashionably dressed, out-of-place in this small town end-of-the-road flower shop. She belonged in a city, with her brisk movements and stern face. She swept her gaze over the small space, and then landed back on Toya.</p><p><i>Can I help you find anything?</i>--but he never got to say that.</p><p>\"Where's Akito?\" she asked. Blunt. Curt. Accusatory, instead of a question.</p><p>Toya swallowed. \"He will be back soon,\" he said. She didn't seem to like that answer. Toya glanced past her, out the window, willing Akito to appear.</p><p>Wait. Why was she here? Who was she? Was she dangerous?</p><p>\"May I ask why you're looking for him?\" Toya followed with. \"Can I help you instead?\"</p><p>\"I'm his sister,\" the woman said, narrowing her eyes. \"You're Toya. I know about you. Akito's told me enough.\"</p><p>His sister? Akito had never said anything about a sister. But Akito had never really talked about his family. Other than that first day, neither of them ever mentioned family. Toya didn't know anything <i>about</i> Akito. How much could Akito have told this woman, his sister, if she was telling the truth? They didn't look too alike. Her hair was brown while Akito's was orange; her eyes a similar shade while Akito's was a warm sage.</p><p>\u201cYou don't believe me?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Well. This is important. I need to talk to him.\"</p><p>\"Would you like to sit as you wait?\" Toya pulled out the stool from behind the counter and offered it to her. It seemed to catch her off guard, and for a moment, Toya could see the similarity between her and Akito. Where Akito wore a mask of sunshine, his sister wore one of glass.</p><p>\"I don't need it,\" she said, words short and clipped. \"This will be short.\"</p><p>Toya nodded. \"Akito will be back soon,\" he repeated.</p><p>\"You said that,\" she said, eyes narrowing slightly in irritation.</p><p>\"I\u2026 Ah\u2013\"</p><p>The bell above the door rang as it opened, cutting Toya off.</p><p>\"Sorry Toya, they were out of\u2026 <i>Ena!?</i> What\u2026 why\u2026 What are you\u2026\"</p><p>The door shut behind Akito like a slow motion film, the edge caught on his sleeve as he froze in the entryway. His eyes flickered towards Toya and for the first time since they'd met, there was <i>something</i> there that he'd never seen before in Akito, but often enough at the other end of his gun. Fear.</p><p>As if sensing Toya's sudden wariness, Akito grimaced, schooling his face into one of neutrality. But his fingers gripped the paper sandwich bag so tightly the paper began to crumple and tear. Toya hurried across the small space to take it, almost having to pry it from Akito's fingers.</p><p>\"I'll go outside,\" Toya said softly.</p><p>\"No, this involves you,\" Akito's sister said at the same time Akito nodded, his eyes never leaving his sister.</p><p>A chill ran down Toya's spine like cold rain, setting and pooling heavily in his gut. It\u2026 involved him?</p><p>He met Akito's eyes, and saw his apprehension mirrored there.</p><p>\"If this is family business, Toya has nothing to do with it,\" Akito said.</p><p>\"But he seems to have plenty to do with you,\" Ena said cooly. Toya resisted the urge to grab Akito's hand, to smooth out the tension in his clenched fist.</p><p>Akito had gone quiet. And very, very still.</p><p>\"You want me to go back,\" Akito said.</p><p>For some reason, annoyance flashed across his sister's face. \"Mizuki was right,\" she muttered. \"But not quite. Akito. I'll be brief. Father wants you back. And it's an order.\"</p><p>\"Ena\u2013\"</p><p>\"No buts.\"</p><p>\"You're the one who said I'd lost enough!\" Akito yelled. Toya flinched\u2013he'd never heard Akito raise his voice like that before. His sister, however, didn't waver.</p><p>\"You've had your break, and it looks like you've enjoyed it,\" she said. \"You have a week.\"</p><p>\"No. I refuse.\"</p><p>Ena waved a hand dismissively. \"That's not an option.\"</p><p>\"What're you gonna do, drag me out of here?\"</p><p>\"Of course not, and I won't need to.\" Her attention suddenly swung towards Toya. \"I haven't introduced myself. Shinonome Ena. Akito's older sister. And it's just the two of us, when it comes to siblings.\"</p><p>\"... Shinonome?\" Toya repeated slowly. He looked to Akito, but Akito was staring at the ground.</p><p>\"I figured he hadn't told you,\" Ena said. \"That's right. He's the only <i>son</i> of the Shinonome family.\"</p><p>\"Akito? Is that true?\"</p><p>\"Why wouldn't it be?\" Ena said.</p><p>\"Please let Akito speak for himself,\" Toya said. Ena, taken aback, fell silent.</p><p>Akito visibly swallowed, and without looking at Toya, said a soft \"yeah, never seemed relevant so didn't mention it.\"</p><p>Toya was brimming with questions, but they were ones he didn't want Akito to answer with his sister here. It felt very, very relevant.</p><p>\"I see,\" Toya said.</p><p>\"A week,\" Ena said, breaking the silence that fell after Toya's words. \"Akito, did you hear me? I'm not any happier about this than you are. And I'm not going to pretend that this is fair to any of us, but none of us have a choice. I know\u2026 I meant it when I said you'd suffered enough. But I guess I wasn't good enough for him.\"</p><p>Bitterness. There was so much bitterness there. And she seemed to care for Akito, under that glass mask of hers. So much history. So much of Akito he didn't know about.</p><p>\"I refuse,\" Akito repeated, but it was weaker this time. \"You can't make me.\"</p><p>\"No, but <i>he</i> can,\" Ena said, and from the way Ena's eyes flickered to Toya as she spoke, he suddenly understood what she'd meant by <i>this involves you.</i></p><p>\"Leave Toya out of this!\" Akito took a step towards his sister, almost growling.</p><p>\"That'll be up to you,\" she said.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>The two men stood there in a frozen tableau, each barely bearing to breathe, each for their own reasons. It was Toya who moved first - to reach past Akito and turn the sign of the shop to read CLOSED.</p><p>He still held the sandwiches Akito had picked up for lunch on the way back from his delivery. His head spun, questions and answers and premonitions and dread swirling in a dark, endless vortex. It threatened to swallow him.</p><p>And it was close to swallowing Akito.</p><p>Toya touched him on the shoulder. \"Akito?\"</p><p>Akito startled like he'd just noticed him there. There was pain there, pain and fear and anguish, but it was the lack of something that gave Toya pause.</p><p>Still:</p><p>\"Let's go home for lunch,\" Toya said. \"It will be fine to close up early for one day.\"</p><p>\"Just one day?\" Akito said, and this time, bitterness seeped out through his words. He frowned, shook his head. Opened the door. Toya locked it.</p><p>They walked back in silence, side by side. They hadn't needed to bring anything this morning, so they'd left Akito's car behind.</p><p>Toya carried the sandwiches. His other hand hung loosely by his side, even though instinct would have him reaching for Akito. There was a cloud around the other man that made him untouchable. There were times, Toya had learned over these few months, that Akito needed space.</p><p>He'd also learned that it would fade, with time. Minutes, hours, days.</p><p>Today, the door had just shut behind them when Akito said:</p><p>\"I guess we should talk.\"</p><p>\"We can wait until\u2013\"</p><p>\"Don't bother,\" Akito said brusquely as he kicked off his shoes, tossing the words over his shoulder. \"You've got questions. Just ask.\"</p><p>Toya considered this as he undid the laces on his own sneakers and lined both pairs neatly against the entryway.</p><p>\"Should we eat first?\" Toya asked, already expecting the shake of Akito's head.</p><p>\"Not a real question. Not hungry right now. You can eat if you want.\"</p><p>Toya just nodded, and put the sandwiches in the fridge. He didn't know when they'd be eating.</p><p>Questions.</p><p>He had so many questions.</p><p>\n  <i>Why did you not think it was relevant?</i>\n</p><p>\"What were those calls you made?\"</p><p>Akito startled, his back stiffening where he still stood in the living room.</p><p>\"What calls?\" he said, and then, in the defeated tone from earlier: \"surprised you didn't ask earlier.\"</p><p>He felt Toya approach him, and then hover behind him. It was strange how quickly Akito had come to trust the other man. They'd met each other mere months ago, but he felt like someone he'd always known.</p><p>\"Was it your sister?\" Toya asked.</p><p>\"Yeah. Ena was one of 'em. I\u2026 I owe her a lot.\" It was a bitter admission. How he'd always resented her for having the childhood he'd never had. How he'd always thought that her help was the least she could do. She hadn't needed to.</p><p>But she also hadn't needed to threaten Toya.</p><p>A plan was beginning to formulate in his mind, and Akito whirled about to come face to face with Toya, a slight frown on his usually expressionless face.</p><p>\"Please calm down,\" Toya said.</p><p>Akito balked. He hadn't said a word yet.</p><p>\"You're thinking about something reckless,\" Toya said. He closed the distance between them, and Akito let himself fall against him, let his head rest against Toya's shoulder. They stood like that for several heartbeats before Toya touched Akito's cheek, gently guiding his head upright. Toya's bangs fell gently over his grey eyes, and Akito brushed them away by reflex. With the same care Toya did everything with, he caught Akito in a tender kiss.</p><p><i>You really are from that world</i>, Akito had said that first time.</p><p>Quieter now, calmer now, and with a deliberateness he'd learned in the past few months overtaking the brusque utility and forced tenderness the years before had trained into him.</p><p><i>Please calm down,</i> Toya had said, and every touch echoed his words. It felt easy, safe, and Akito selfishly fell into this false sense of safety. Easier to let Toya move them into the bedroom in small, gradual steps, slowly, as if guiding a skittish cat. He never let go of Akito for a second, and Akito leaned into that touch\u2013his lips, his hands, his fingers. It wasn't until Toya had gently lowered Akito onto the bed that he released that tenuous connection, as if waiting until he was sure that Akito was safe and grounded.</p><p>\"Toya,\" Akito murmured into the space between their lips as Toya drew back.</p><p>\"Akito?\"</p><p>\"I've calmed down,\" he said. Toya gazed at him steadily for a few moments, and then without saying a word, picked up Akito's hand and pressed it against his chest. Toya's answer was the hammering of Akito's heart.</p><p>A strange, half-smothered laugh bubbled up in Akito's throat, his eyes falling closed. All he'd wanted was to sit in peace among his sunflowers, but it was something life would deny him.</p><p>Toya's weight blanketed him, his lips pressing soft kisses down Akito's neck. His hands smoothed up Akito's stomach, his chest, pushing his shirt up as he caressed his skin. Akito pushed up into that touch, reaching instinctively for Toya's hand, his fingers closing around the delicate wrist, guiding Toya lower, lower, <i>lower</i>, the pads of Toya's fingers trailing against his skin. He let out a sharp gasp when Toya took over, palm splayed against Akito's hip, pushing down the waistband of his pants.</p><p>\"Shh,\" Toya murmured against Akito's shoulder. \"It will be alright.\"</p><p>He let out a shuddering breath, weight sinking into the bed. Behind his closed eyelids, he seemed to see Toya pull away, only the lingering phantom touch of his weight and warmth remaining against Akito's chest. He seemed to see Toya briefly catch his lip between his teeth as he gazed down at him. Felt his weight shift, and he opened his eyes to Toya's clear, grey ones.</p><p>\"You'll be alright,\" Toya said, fingers brushing Akito's cheek. He was gentle as he undressed Akito, his hands roaming across Akito's bare body, every touch echoing his words.</p><p>He wanted to believe him.</p><p>If Toya was from that world, then what was he?</p><p>Toya's soft lips had just touched Akito's cock when Akito pushed Toya off as he surged upright.</p><p>\"Akito?\" Toya's tongue wet his lips, his brows creased.</p><p>\"No.\"</p><p>He flipped their positions, slid down the side of the bed, pulling Toya to the edge. Toya's eyes flickered in understanding. His fingers tangled in Akito's hair, tugging gently at his scalp. Akito undid the fasteners of Toya's pants, dragging them down along with his underwear.</p><p>\"Please. Toya, please.\" Akito breathed against Toya's stomach, straining away from Toya's grasp. He licked down the tangle of hair, rough against his tongue.</p><p>Toya guided Akito lower, fingers tracing the line of Akito's jaw. Akito needed no prompting to take in all of Toya at once, and it was all Toya gasped, almost undone right then and there. But Akito <i>needed</i> right now. Toya carded his fingers through his hair, a gentle motion, before he thrust roughly into Akito's mouth.</p><p>Akito nearly gagged as Toya's cock hit the back of his throat, causing Toya to still. Akito squeezed Toya's arm in irritation, glaring up at him as best as he could. And Toya always tried his best to be helpful.</p><p>Akito clung to Toya as Toya fucked relentlessly into his mouth, down his throat. It felt easy to let his mind fall slack as he let his throat fall slack, the taste of Toya on the back of his tongue a faint, fuzzy warmth. His eyelids fluttered shut, world narrowing down to his hand on Toya's thigh, Toya's fingers in his hair, and Toya's cock in his mouth.</p><p>\"Good boy,\" Toya praised Akito. It sent the warmth that'd been slowly growing inside Akito into a frenzy, firing through his limbs and his own cock. Akito groaned, reaching down to touch himself.</p><p>He stroked himself in time to Toya's rhythm. Every time Toya fucked into his mouth. It was so <i>easy</i> to let go like this.</p><p>Easy. Safe.</p><p>It was over too soon. Toya's soft touch against Akito's jaw was a warning that pulled Akito back into his own body, just enough to swallow Toya's come, his throat constricting around Toya's cock. He forced his eyes open and gazed upwards with heavy eyelids; Toya's composure undone, his parted lips, the rapid rise and fall of his chest, his eyes still slightly glazed as he looked down at Akito.</p><p>Toya pulled Akito back onto the bed with him. <i>\"You shouldn't do that to your knees,\"</i> Toya's voice echoed in Akito's mind\u2013he'd tripped the other day and crashed down onto the flagstones, but the bruises had all but faded already. Toya was still fussing over it.</p><p>Still, it was nice to lean back against Toya's chest, their bodies pressed together. Toya's fingers joined Akito's around his hard cock.</p><p>It didn't take much for Akito to completely let go.</p><p>Toya held Akito close, wrapping his arms around Akito's chest. He wasn't sure when Toya had shed his shirt, but it was nice to be pressed against him, skin to skin, heartbeat to heartbeat, breath to breath.</p><p>But the morning, the past few hours, suddenly bared its claws, talons tearing through the web of safety.</p><p>Akito exhaled deeply, extracting himself from Toya's embrace. He rolled over onto his back.</p><p>And found he didn't know what to say.</p><p>Toya was torn between gathering Akito back to him, and letting Akito take the lead. He found Akito's hand, interlacing their fingers.</p><p>Questions. He'd had questions to ask. There was so much about Akito he didn't know\u2013so much that Akito didn't want to know himself. But now, Toya could sense that those answers were ones Akito was ready to give. Toya didn't know what the right questions were to ask. His eyes traced the firm line of Akito's muscled body, lean, but well toned with physical activity. It wasn't just from carrying bags of soil, though. Akito preferred to practice in private, and Toya had learned when he should take longer walks.</p><p>\"When did you learn to fight?\" Toya asked.</p><p>There was a question behind the question that kept Akito from looking away from the ceiling.</p><p>\"After,\" he said, and there was no need for Toya to ask <i>after what?</i>. Akito grimaced, the memory bitter. \"Not that it'd have done much good before.\"</p><p>\"You were young,\" Toya said.</p><p>\"Or I'd never have believed them,\" Akito said. Toya's gaze was quizzical, but this was something Akito didn't want to explain. He turned to Toya, met his eyes. \"But I'd run, I said so, damn the consequences.\"</p><p>Toya found his hand and squeezed.</p><p>\"You said you didn't think it was relevant,\" Toya said. By all accounts, Toya was calm, unfazed, but just as Toya had learned to read behind Akito's brusque exterior, Akito had learned that Toya chose his words carefully. When he could. When it mattered. But here, now, they came fragmented and piecemeal.</p><p>\"It shouldn't have been,\" Akito said. \"It wasn't supposed to have been.\"</p><p>Toya nodded, his expression solemn.</p><p>\"Your sister is the reason you have the shop. You shouldn't be angry at her.\" A pause. \"You also shouldn't be angry at yourself.\"</p><p>\"Why'd I be pissed at <i>myself</i>?\" Akito snapped, at the same moment he realised that yeah, just a bit, he might've been. Not for taking in Toya. Never for that. But for believing it wasn't relevant. That'd been fucking stupid of him. He exhaled deeply. Turned back to stare at the ceiling. \"Doesn't matter anyway. Don't even wanna think why Dad wants to see me.\"</p><p>\"Then I will\u2014\"</p><p>\"You won't do a fucking thing,\" Akito ground out. He sat up, stared down at Toya, who looked back at him with the same steady expression as always.</p><p>He too sat up, and Akito noticed that their hands were still interlinked, that Toya's hand was clamped between his fingers like a vice, that it was almost like Akito had pulled Toya up with the sheer force of that single connection. But he didn't let go.</p><p>\"Akito,\" Toya said, and something in Akito faltered, hearing his name spoken like that. Like he <i>mattered</i>. Like he <i>cared</i>. \"If I leave now, then it will not matter if your sister reveals my location.\"</p><p>\"You can't be that fucking naive,\" Akito said, voice low, his eyes fixed on their hands. <i>A pianist's fingers</i>, he'd thought, when he'd first met Toya. He didn't play piano. He should've. \"Dad'll come up with something else. Burn down the shop or something. No, we both go.\"</p><p>\"Go where?\" Toya asked.</p><p>\"I dunno, wherever <i>you</i> were gonna go,\" Akito snapped. They both knew that Toya didn't have anywhere to run either. Akito sighed, dragged a hand down his face. Fuck. Would've been easier to do this while reckless. What'd his half-formed idea been anyway? Leave, let Toya take over the shop? Then what, leave him at his family's mercy? Should've been to send Toya away in that case. But no, he couldn't do that. Wouldn't help. They'd both go. <i>Go where?</i> was the question.</p><p>\"She gave us a week,\" Toya gently reminded him. \"We should think this through calmly.\"</p><p>\"Like you're calm?\" Akito said, more cutting than he meant, and was rewarded by a small hitch in Toya's shoulders, as if he were flinching away from his words. \"No. Don't\u2026 you're right. Dammit, but you're right. Ena's not stupid. If I don't show up, dad'll blame her. She's gonna be keeping an eye on us. Or someone is. How the fuck am I supposed to be <i>calm</i>? What the fuck am I supposed to do?\"</p><p>He felt the despair climbing up his spine again, filling his lungs.</p><p>\"Akito?\" Toya's voice prodded at his consciousness, and Akito blinked as he mentally grabbed onto it like a life ring.</p><p>\"Yeah?\"</p><p>\"What if\u2026 Have you considered agreeing to your sister's request?\" Toya said.</p><p>\" 'course I have,\" Akito said. He paused.</p><p>\"You haven't,\" Toya said, before Akito could continue. \"You've considered why you do not wish to see the head of the Shinonome family, but haven't considered all the possibilities of a meeting with your family.\"</p><p>\"I barely remember 'em,\" Akito said, and it wasn't quite a lie. \"Never saw my dad much anyway. Dunno what happened to mom. Not much of a family. Kinda fucked up, not that I'd know what it's supposed to be like.\"</p><p>He stopped, words frozen. But Toya hadn't reacted. Probably didn't want to talk about it. Hell, forget about Toya's family, Akito had never asked him his family name. Hadn't seemed relevant, just like his own hadn't seemed relevant. Shouldn't have been.</p><p>\"What would be the worst outcome?\" Toya asked, prodding him back into the present.</p><p>\"I\u2026\" To rejoin the family? To give up the shop? To\u2026 \"Nothing good,\" Akito settled with.</p><p>\"I understand,\" Toya said. Impossible, because not even Akito understood what he himself was thinking.</p><p>\"Understand what?\" Akito asked wryly.</p><p>\"That you are calmer now, and we can think about it before acting recklessly. Would you like me to make some coffee? I can also try to make pancakes\u2013\"</p><p>The last word was barely out of Toya's mouth before Akito nearly flung himself out of bed.</p><p>\"No, absolutely not. <i>I'm</i> making the pancakes, you're not touching the stove. Have you forgotten what happened last time? What're you laughing at!?\"</p><p>Toya <i>was</i> laughing in that small, quiet way of his. He shook his head, like it was a secret for himself. \"Please put on pants before leaving the room, the living room window is open,\" was all Toya said, before getting off the bed himself.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>It was after the pancakes, the sandwiches abandoned in the fridge, after the coffee, and after the 'leftover' pancakes, that Akito went to sit in the garden while Toya insisted on washing the batter bowl and the dishes.</p><p>There was a table between two patches of sunflowers. It wasn't too far from where he'd first seen Toya, when he'd thought him beautiful, injured, and afraid. Mere months ago, he reminded himself. Barely any time ago. A boy drenched in blood, falling into his life, shortly after daybreak. Why'd he hide him, help him? Because he was beautiful? Because he felt bad? Because Toya reminded him of himself?</p><p>\"To kill someone\u2026 what's that like?\"</p><p>Toya paused behind him, a hesitation.</p><p>\"Ugh, don't answer that\u2013\"</p><p>\"Are you saying that because you don't want to know the answer, or because you don't want me to have to answer?\" Toya asked. He lingered for a moment by Akito's shoulder before walking past him, taking the other seat.</p><p>Akito looked down at the table. Dirt seemed to be embedded in the crevices. He ought to wash that off.</p><p>\"I\u2026 don't mind,\" Toya said hesitantly. \"I asked you many uncomfortable things as well.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but that doesn't mean <i>you</i> have to,\" Akito said.</p><p>\"Ah, so it was the second,\" Toya said.</p><p>Akito exhaled, glanced at the flowers, and nodded.</p><p>And then: silence.</p><p>Toya was staring at the flowers. He spent more time in the greenhouse\u2013the garden was still Akito's. They were unfamiliar to Toya in a way the greenhouse flowers weren't. It was a hollow feeling; the thought of leaving them behind.</p><p>There was a blankness in Toya's eyes that frightened him. As if he'd dove so far back in his memories that he was lost to the present.</p><p>\"If you hadn't stopped me\u2026 I think I would have been like her.\"</p><p>\"Huh\u2026?\"</p><p>\"I\u2026 don't know if I could have done it, if she hadn't\u2026\" Toya swallowed, closed his eyes. His voice, always quiet, dropped to barely above a whisper. \"... hadn't begged me to kill her. If you hadn't stopped me from going back, I think I would have been like her.\"</p><p><i>What do you mean?</i> The question stuck to the roof of his mouth, choking him. But Toya continued anyway, halting, hesitant, stumbling\u2013but persistent.</p><p>\"You said, that day, <i>that</i> world was all I had ever known. Then you know that I thought it was the only thing I could do, that it meant I was one of the lucky ones. I knew there was another world, and sometimes the older kids would speak of it longingly, but some of them said it was a terrible place. That they liked being safe, not being hungry, not being scared of dying. There were monsters outside. Before that, I didn't know what that was like\u2026 being scared of dying. But when they put the gun in my hands, I understood\u2013that I was scared of dying, but she was scared of living.</p><p>\" I\u2026 don't remember what happened after that, but it was probably like you said, Akito. Sometimes it hurt, but as long as I did what they told me\u2026 it was home. I had to go home. It was bad of me, because I knew they were afraid but I still did it. Killed them. Ah, but you asked what it was like. I\u2026 I don't know. I'm sorry, Akito, I never thought about that before.\"</p><p>\"Fuck, that's\u2026\u201c</p><p>Akito had sat there, frozen, as Toya spoke. What was he supposed to say? Was he supposed to say anything? But the beat of silence after Toya's last words dragged those two words out of him before he could stop them. Toya looked at him quizzically, and Akito shook his head out of habit.</p><p>\"It's what?\" Toya asked.</p><p>\"Fucked up. That's fucked up. Fuck. You shouldn't have\u2026 that shouldn't have happened.\"</p><p>\"Is it not the same everywhere?\" Toya's question was too nonchalant. Too matter-of-fact. \"Does the Shinonome family not do the same thing?\"</p><p>\"Fuck no! Not\u2026 Not like that,\" Akito said. \"I mean\u2026 we\u2026 it's not\u2026 but it's not much better. Don't wanna fucking think about it. I want nothing to do with it, none of it.\"</p><p>\"That is why you do not wish to see your family?\" It was a question, but the way Toya said it, it meant he already knew that Akito would answer with a silent nod.</p><p>\"Can we\u2026 can we sleep for tonight?\" Akito asked, not quite meeting Toya's eyes.</p><p>Toya kissed the top of Akito's head and held him tight for a moment before he said \"yes, please\".</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u2014----</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Akito woke in a daze\u2013the panic of an empty bed clamped him a moment later.</p><p>\"Toya?\" He sat up slowly, feeling the gaping space beside him. His heart only started beating again when his fingers landed on a sheet of paper, left prominently on the pillow.</p><p>\"Fuck, you scared me,\" Akito breathed as he read Toya's neat handwriting.</p><p>\n  <i>I left for a walk.<br />\nI didn't want to wake you.</i>\n</p><p>He crumpled the note and shoved it in his pocket. No telling when he'd be back like this. He <i>would</i> be back, Akito was sure of it. Toya wasn't the type to go back on his word.</p><p>Didn't blame him for the walk, though. Toya probably needed to clear his head as bad as Akito did. He'd also developed a tendency to vanish when Akito needed to be alone. No idea how Toya'd figured that out, but he was thankful for it.</p><p>He was halfway through his morning routine before the futility of it suddenly struck him.</p><p>It'd become abundantly clear that the shop would be closed for more than just one day. He glanced at the greenhouse with its neat, flower filled shelves. His eyes lingered on the pile of straw he'd shoved Toya under that first day. <i>That</i> straw was long gone. Would've been by now, even if he hadn't trashed it because of the blood. He shook his head, dispelling the memory of panic. The flowers looked good. As long as the sprinklers kept working, some might survive. For what? What was the point?</p><p>Akito sighed, turning his back on its glass walls.</p><p>Toya would be a while. Might as well water his garden. Not like he had anything better to do.</p><p>It was eerily similar. A black car pulling up. Two men getting out. Intimidating.</p><p>No Toya this time, though.</p><p>Akito straightened, putting down the watering can.</p><p>\"Can I help you gentlemen?\" he asked, his eyes narrowing. They weren't the same guys. But they were bad news. On top of everything else, he didn't need to deal with a Thing One and Thing Two. Thug One and Thug Two.</p><p>\"Cut the crap. We know he's here.\"</p><p>\"Who're you?\" Akito crossed his arms, glowering at them. They were both taller than him. Maybe even taller than Toya.</p><p>\"Shut up and step aside,\" Thug One said, taking a step towards him.</p><p>\"Get your ugly mugs outta here before I call the cops,\" Akito said. He refused to move.</p><p>\"Ha. The cops? You think we're scared of the cops? You're going to call the cops when <i>he's</i> here?\"</p><p>He?</p><p>They were here for Toya\u2026?</p><p>At a time like this?</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \"I dunno what you're talking about, but if you don't get the fuck out of here, you're trespassing.\"</p><p>Dammit, he should've insisted on getting Toya a phone\u2013could warn him not to come back. At least he wasn't here right now.</p><p>Ena wouldn't break her word, but he wouldn't put it past his dad.</p><p>\"Who the fuck are you to him anyway? Is he that good in bed?\"</p><p>Akito lunged forward at Thug Two, snarling. \"You take that back!\"</p><p>His punch landed with a satisfying crunch, but that was all he got before he doubled over from Thug One driving his fist into his stomach, his vision momentarily blacking out as all the air left his body.</p><p>\"So he is here, that blue haired brat,\" Akito heard, through the fog in his head. \"Shot up our office and thought he'd get away with it. It's early. Check the bedroom.\"</p><p>Akito staggered to his feet. Too late, the other guy was already slamming open the unlocked door.</p><p>He had to get them out before Toya came back.</p><p>\"It's too late, he's gone!\" Akito yelled. He didn't get far. A well placed elbow against his back had him crumpling to the ground. His hands dug into fertile soil, and he felt flowers crunch under his face.</p><p>Shit. He couldn't stay down like this.</p><p>He swung his arm at the guy's ankles, catching him off guard enough to make him stumble. It gave Akito enough time to get back to his feet. Spared a look for his garden\u2013trampled.</p><p>\"He's not here,\" Akito repeated. \"So get the fuck out.\"</p><p>He was better prepared this time and blocked the punch. Guy hit like a truck.</p><p>\"Don't try us, brat. That Shinonome chick was here yesterday. We know you're hiding him.\"</p><p><i>That Shinonome chick?</i> Ena. They were talking about Ena. But that meant\u2026 they didn't know she was his sister. They didn't know he was the Shinonome son.</p><p>\"Yeah? So that's who she was?\" Akito spared a glance behind him. He didn't like the sounds coming from his house. Was gonna be a pain to clean. He kept a wary eye on the guy in front of him, settling into a fighting stance. Still hurt to breathe. He had to get them out of here. And then he could worry about his garden.</p><p>\"Man, you really don't know,\" he said. \"Took him in because he's got a pretty face?\"</p><p>\"Shut the fuck up,\" Akito growled. He didn't repeat his mistake and swallowed his anger deep into his chest this time. \"And I told you. He's gone. He's left.\"</p><p>\"Oi, any luck?\" Thug One yelled.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Two said, spitting in disgust. Akito warily shifted his position, trying to keep an eye on both of them at the same time.</p><p>\"I told you. He left. He's gone,\" he said.</p><p>Wait. Toya's note.</p><p>\"He left during the night,\" Akito quickly added. \"He left a note.\"</p><p>He reached into his pocket for the crumpled sheet of paper, feeling for the torn edge. Carefully, he ripped it blindly in two. He couldn't fuck up here. They were watching him like a hawk with a mouse.</p><p>\"I told you. He left.\" He held out what he hoped was the correct half.</p><p>Two, clearly the more junior of the pair, snatched it from Akito's hand. He read it, frowned, and then nodded at the other guy.</p><p>\"Might've faked it,\" One said.</p><p>\"It's not. He's gone. Left during the night. If you get out now I won't call the cops. Or do you want breaking and entering and property damage on top of trespassing?\" Akito bared his teeth, staring them down. \"Fucking pieces of shit,\" he spat out.</p><p>A third voice jerked at his attention like a barbed fish hook. He hadn't noticed there was someone else in the car. \"Someone's coming!\" a man yelled through the car window.</p><p>\"Right. Bring him with us,\" One said.</p><p><i>At least they were leaving before Toya got back,</i> was his last conscious thought.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>- - -</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>There was an unfamiliar car.</p><p>Toya pulled up short, senses firing into alarm.</p><p>Something was very, very wrong.</p><p>Akito wasn't in the yard. There was no sign of Akito. Toya had instinctively ducked off the road and approached the house from the back. There were clear signs of a scuffle. Multiple people. Dirt marked by footprints.</p><p>He didn't have time to look further, not when an unfamiliar voice sounded out calmly behind him. \"Hello there,\" the stranger said. He had a gun.</p><p>Toya pivoted, instinctively ducking and jabbing upwards. Only to catch empty air. He hopped back, throwing up his guard.</p><p>\"Woah, easy there, we're on the same side,\" the stranger said, who'd stepped back, hands in the air. His hair was a striking shade of purple. He smiled wryly at Toya's wary look, then casually spun the gun in his hand before slipping it into his back pocket.</p><p>\"Toya, right? Shinonome had me keeping an eye on the two of you\u2013\"</p><p>\"What did you do to Akito?\" Toya asked, voice icy.</p><p>\"I did nothing,\" the purple haired stranger said, lips twisting into the semblance of a smile in response to some private joke. \"Which is part of the problem, quite unfortunately. You see, we hadn't considered something like this and he <i>was</i> sleeping quite soundly when you abruptly left. So, I followed you.\"</p><p>Toya straightened, sensing the truth in this strange man's words. \"Akito's sister told you to watch us,\" he said.</p><p>\"Something like that. Like the kid said, Shinonome the elder would've blamed her if the two of you vanished.\"</p><p>\"You were listening,\" Toya said. '<i>The kid</i>' must've meant Akito. This man was older than them.</p><p>\"I was, which is also how I know that the kid's abductors don't know who he is, and it sounds like they have a grudge against <i>you</i>. Mind, I got here not long before you did. It seems like someone else scared them off. Three of them, I believe. Now, I suggest we take a look at the damage those hooligans did, and perhaps sit down inside and discuss our plans.\"</p><p>\"I don't know what your plan is, but I <i>will</i> find Akito,\" Toya said, hands balling into fists. This man was too <i>calm</i>.</p><p>\"As I said, we're on the same side here. There will be some very upset people if anything happens to Shinonome Junior and we want to prevent that, hm? Please, lead the way, you're the one after all who lives here, not me.\" He gestured at Toya, nodding towards the house.</p><p>That Toya lived in, yes, but only because Akito had taken him in.</p><p>Swallowing his suspicions and discomfort, Toya obeyed. If this man was working for Akito's sister and father, then as much as Toya was loathe to admit, he had more resources than Toya could imagine. Akito could berate him after for accepting this man's help, because it put him in further debt to his family and that was the opposite of what he wanted. But first, he needed Akito <i>back</i>. Safe. Realistically, working with this man was his best chance.</p><p>The house was a mess. It didn't surprise him. The man had clearly been listening in, and he'd mentioned 'the damage'. Toya was acutely aware of the stranger's presence, not that he was making any effort to be scarce.</p><p>\"The kid has a good eye,\" the stranger commented, eyeing the trashed decor.</p><p>Toya glanced at him as he righted the furniture. \"You haven't told me your name,\" Toya said, much too bluntly. He swallowed the urge to apologise, to reword his question.</p><p>\"Ah, you're right. You can call me Rui, Toya-kun. You're much more polite than the kid\u2013\"</p><p>\"Akito. His name is Akito.\"</p><p>\"Right, right.\" Rui waved a hand dismissively. \"More than <i>Akito</i>. You do know that you're the only one that calls him that outside of his sister? No, of course not, how silly of me. That's unimportant. Now, can you think of anyone who has a bone or two to pick with you? Perhaps someone whose office 'you shot up', I believe were their words?\"</p><p>Toya's blood ran cold. Not because he couldn't think of anyone, but because\u2026 \"There are a few. I\u2026 don't remember.\"</p><p>Rui quirked an eyebrow. \"Ah, right, I did hear you were quite efficient. Nonetheless, if you could give me a list, the two of us should be able to narrow it down between us. Most recent first, if you'd please.\" He snagged the pile of sticky notes that Toya and Akito kept on the fridge to jot down grocery needs, and slid it towards Toya on the now righted table, producing a pen from somewhere within his own pockets.</p><p>With a jolt, Toya realised that this strange man was doing for him much like he'd tried with Akito the night before. Calm him down. Think things through. He was right, of course\u2013what hope did either of them have to chase blindly after a car that could've gone anywhere by now?</p><p>Rui had taken a thin tablet out from some inner pocket, and was scrolling through it with one long finger, making a call at the same time. It went through an earpiece, so Toya had no chance of overhearing the other end.</p><p>\"Ah, Mizuki, good. Yes, an emergency I'm afraid. Just you, if you don't mind, I'll send over a list. Hm, I believe the two of us will suffice, but if you wish to meet us there\u2013where? That is\u2026 ah, perfect, thank you Toya\u2013\" Rui paused to skim the list that Toya wordlessly passed over. He'd narrowed it down to three that seemed most likely, and one of them must've been a hit by the way Rui's eyes lit up. \"Yes, I'll send it now, and then we'll be on our way, hopefully before they rough up Junior any further. A message? Of course. Take care, Mizuki.\"</p><p>He'd barely hung up when he turned to Toya, his eyes narrow and appraising. \"The message is for you,\" he said. A pause, during which their eyes met, and Toya was caught off-guard by a flash of deep solemnity, like glimpsing the bottom of an ancient lake. A smile played about Rui's lips, like he was laughing at a private joke. \"The words were <i>'thanks for taking care of li'l bro'</i>--as I said, you are the only other person to call him 'Akito'.\"</p><p>Toya was about to protest, because <i>everyone</i> in their life called him Akito, because that was his name, but this stranger was not from their life (and it was with a jolt that he thought 'our' life), but from one Akito had lived long before these few idyllic months. And it was from that one, Toya was soberly reminded, from which their present situation arose.</p><p>\"You seem to have determined where Akito is,\" Toya said, filing the message from 'Mizuki' for later. Akito's sister had mentioned them, he was sure of it.</p><p>If Toya's bluntness surprised Rui, he didn't show it.</p><p>\"With your help, I have a good idea,\" Rui said.</p><p>\"Then let's go\u2013\"</p><p>\"Ahh, but an idea is not the same as knowledge,\" Rui said, cutting him off. \"I understand your eagerness <i>and</i> I appreciate the urgency, yet what good would it do to run a mile west when we should have gone a mile east, except to run three miles when a third of that would have done? You're a rather level-headed boy, and that will prove to be much more helpful here than Junior's rashness. I have some information here, and here,\" Rui tapped his tablet and then his temple in succession, \"but it pales to the database back at headquarters, and that, I believe, is what will allow us to surprise the kid's captors. After all, I have no doubt that they <i>intend</i> you to find them, or their bait would serve no purpose. But it is difficult to say what will happen in the interim, or how long that would take. Regardless, I have placed some more\u2026 visual surveillance in the surrounding area, so if the criminals return to the scene of the crime, and I believe they will, we'll be well apprised.\"</p><p>Rui regarded Toya coolly as he spoke. He'd been a tad surprised to find the boy so hot-headed when his prior knowledge, as limited as it was, spoke to a quiet and calculating man that understood the importance of action with purpose, rather than pure emotion. Something that kid could've stood to learn. Perhaps it would've kept him from getting himself kidnapped and saved them all this headache and trouble. Rui thought of himself as a rather unflappable person himself, but even he feared Ena's reaction once she inevitably learned of his failure. Ah well, he was a decent shot but no sniper, and even if he'd been sufficiently close, was certainly no good in close combat. Fighting\u2026 wasn't exactly his specialty. And what was done was done. No, he needed the back-up, and it reassured him that the back-up and underlying cause for this headache had begun to breathe again.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\"You only had audio inside the house,\" Toya said, after a moment.</p><p>\"I didn't have much to work with,\" Rui admitted, \"and I did consider your\u2026 privacy.\"</p><p>Toya flushed, because even without knowing what exactly Rui had heard, or how much, the man had certainly formed his own, correct, conclusions.</p><p>\"And this Mizuki is searching your database,\" Toya bulldozed on, trying to cover his own embarrassment.</p><p>\"Correct, and I imagine it won't be long before we have what we need. There is one more thing, Toya, and I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty of\u2026 canvassing your rooms in the short time I had while Shinonome conversed with the two of you\u2013\"</p><p>\"I do mind,\" Toya interjected bluntly.</p><p>\"Regardless,\" Rui continued, waving his complaint aside, \"you may find something\u2026 interesting in the bottom of the third drawer.\"</p><p>Toya frowned, and only frowned harder when Rui's eyes danced with amusement. Eyes that were drawn to the tablet by a notification.</p><p>\"Go arm yourself,\" Rui said, positively grinning now, with the sort of madness unique to a certain type of unhinged brilliance. \"The game, as one says, is afoot.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>- - -</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Akito spluttered awake, jarred into an unpleasant consciousness. Again. He coughed, shaking his head in a futile attempt to dispel the water.</p><p>\"Awake, Princess?\"</p><p>\"Fuck off,\" Akito growled halfheartedly. The answering blow was anything but, driving the breath out of him as his back slammed against the steel beam he was secured to.</p><p>He wasn't sure how long it'd been since they'd taken him, but this was his third wet and rude awakening. Blindfolded, he had no way of tracking time, even if there'd been a window to the outdoor world. He was hungry but not faint, so it couldn't be more than a few hours. His hands were cuffed behind him around some pipe, pulling uncomfortably at his arms and shoulders whether he stood or sat. Another pair of cuffs linked his ankles, although with the way his leg was throbbing, he doubted he'd run far even without the hobble. His unconscious body had settled on his knees, and Akito struggled to maneuver himself as upright as he could.</p><p>He'd heard them take photos. When he was not quite conscious first, and then again after they'd dragged him roughly to his feet '<i>for a proper photo-shoot, pretty boy</i>'.</p><p>He wished they'd stop calling him that.</p><p>\"See, I think you're a lying brat,\" his captor was saying. Akito hadn't noticed him speaking at first. His head was ringing with a fuzzy silence that concerned him in a vague, persistent way. This guy hadn't been one of the three who'd crashed his place. He figured there were at least another two or three guys, probably more. Didn't take a genius to figure out Akito was strung up here as bait.</p><p>\"Your precious <i>Toya</i> didn't leave. Maybe that note was real, maybe it was from last week, but he'll be back. And when he does get back, he'll have\u2026 a surprise.\"</p><p>\"I told ya. He left. That chick scared him off,\" Akito spat, biting out each word like it pained him. \"You were too late. Should've\u2013<i>urk!</i>\"</p><p>\"Did I say you could speak? I didn't think so.\"</p><p>\"Yeah? 'Cause you're giving your evil guy monologue?\" Akito flinched, knowing he'd earned himself another beating.</p><p>Instead, the evil guy chuckled. Not a proper villain chuckle, but close enough to be ridiculous.</p><p>And <i>then</i> Akito grunted as something hard and cold slammed into his face.</p><p><i>Fuck</i> that hurt.</p><p>\"`Evil guy'? And if I'm evil, what does that make your <i>Toya</i>?\"</p><p>\"Get his name out of your filthy mouth,\" Akito growled, head ringing.</p><p>\"Toya? That name? You don't like hearing your lover's name? Pity, because we'll be inviting Toya here very soon.\"</p><p>Akito seethed, willing himself to shut the fuck up. His face was throbbing, and something warm and wet trickled down his cheek. He wasn't crying, the water in his hair was still cold, it didn't take a genius to guess it was blood.</p><p>\"Nothing to say to that? When we've <i>barely</i> hurt you, and your sweet, little Toya's killed\u2026 I wonder, did you ever ask him how many? Go on, answer.\"</p><p>\"Fuck you.\"</p><p>\"Tsk, wrong answer. But I'm feeling generous today. The answer\u2026 Well. You called me evil? If so, the only word for him is\u2026 monster. Does that frighten you? Living with a cold blooded killer\u2026 taking his life once wouldn't pay a tenth of his debt.\"</p><p>The truth was, Akito both didn't want to know, and he could guess. The four turbulent years he'd spent at home\u2026 knowing his father's men were killing people on <i>his</i>, Akito's, behalf made him feel dirty. They were good at it too.</p><p>If they were here, these chumps would get their brains blown out in seconds.</p><p>But even if he could, Akito wasn't desperate enough to beg for their help. For his father's help. At least, not yet.</p><p>And he hoped to god that when Toya came, he wasn't stupid enough to show up alone.</p><p>When? If. He shouldn't.</p><p>Who the fuck would he even bring?</p><p>A sinking feeling in his chest: Ena.</p><p>Well, he owed her enough as it was. Not like one more piece to that pile of debt would make it any better or worse.</p><p>God, and this guy wouldn't stop talking.</p><p>\"Shut up already,\" Akito muttered. \"I keep telling you he's gone.\"</p><p>\"And that's bad news for you, princess,\" a new voice said. Akito tensed as footsteps accompanied the approaching voice. Fingers roughly tilted his chin up and he flinched away, slamming his head into the metal beam again. His vision exploded white, and words seemed fuzzy.</p><p>\"If what you say is true, then we have no more use for you. Normally we'd just dump your body, but you're a feisty pretty face and there's people who pay good, hard cash for that.\"</p><p>Akito stilled, his skin suddenly numb, a shiver running down his spine, ice sloughing down his back, colder than the water he'd been repeatedly doused with.</p><p>\"So that's got your attention, has it?\"</p><p>\"Shut up,\" Akito said, cursing himself for how weak his voice was. He swallowed dryly. \"Shut up!\"</p><p>\"Not his face,\" he heard, before doubling over from a blow to the stomach, and then crumpling to the ground at the sharp crack of something striking his legs.</p><p><i>Fuck</i> it hurt.</p><p><i>Let me go,</i> a small voice in his head pleaded. <i>Just let me go.</i> He couldn't let that voice out.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, tears wetting the blindfold. It hurt to breathe, but he had to try. It hurt. Everything hurt. Like it used to. Each breath was shaky. Difficult.</p><p>\n  <i>Let me go. I wanna go home.</i>\n</p><p>Such a young voice.</p><p>He whimpered when a hand closed roughly around his shoulder and hauled him to his feet. He tried to twist out of that grasp but all he got for his troubles was a hard shake and a blow to the chest. The click of a camera, and then the hand was gone, and he crashed to the ground without the bruising support. His arms wrenched behind him was the only thing that saved his face from the concrete.</p><p>\n  <i>Let go of me!</i>\n</p><p>There were whispered instructions, but Akito's brain was too foggy to pick out the words. He shoved that voice down, trying to focus on the present.</p><p>Damn, whatever Toya had done for these fuckers to hate him that much\u2026 Akito could guess. But it wasn't like he could've let Toya alone. A whore house kid. Just another brat.</p><p>How many people had Toya killed?</p><p>He didn't want to know. The coffee. Toya loved coffee. Akito hadn't drank much coffee before him, but now the mornings always smelled of coffee, and sometimes the afternoons too. He liked listening to music. Fancy music, pianos and violins and orchestras. The stray cat that'd show up at the store, and sometimes follow them home, winding between Toya's legs. He loved animals. Toya's smile was always so gentle.</p><p>Monster. Cold blooded killer.</p><p>That wasn't fair, he'd just been another kid trying to survive.</p><p>All the aunties loved the new, quiet boy who'd moved in with Akito. <i>What a kind, thoughtful boy,</i> they'd said.</p><p>Monster.</p><p>At least Toya'd never hurt someone for fun. He'd just been trying to survive.</p><p>\n  <i>What a good child, always so helpful, always ready to do anything we ask.</i>\n</p><p>That was right. It was just how things worked. Did what you had to do to live. There was blood on Akito's hands too. Plenty of it, even if he hadn't done it himself. His sister had swore it, the moment she'd laid eyes on him for the first time in years. Every single person who'd ever hurt Akito would pay. And they paid in blood.</p><p>The fogginess in his head was spreading. Unconsciousness beckoned. Might as well pass the time as best he could. He'd get another rude awakening soon. Only way he'd get his mind off the sharp, stabbing pain in his leg.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>-</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Trepidation dogged Toya as they drove up to the rendezvous. His heart kept dropping in his chest, as if the danger was growing each time. This was his fault. A job left half done.</p><p>He reached for the gun in his pocket, and the touch of hard metal calmed him. There had been a veritable armoury stashed in their clothes chest, outfitted with attachments that Toya was sure would be useful in different circumstances. He'd slipped the thin vest under his shirt, but had abandoned the rest. He appreciated the effort Rui had put into the collection. Right now, he needed simplicity. Reassurance.</p><p>\"Nervous?\" Rui asked, sensing Toya's discomfort.</p><p>\"No. I'm worried about Akito,\" Toya said, brows creasing. It was the truth.</p><p>\"As expected,\" Rui mused as they pulled to a stop behind a warehouse of sorts.</p><p>A girl with pink hair was waiting for them. She grinned and waved at them, jogging over at an easy pace as the two men got out of the car. This girl, with ribbons in her hair and wearing a dress lined in lace, had to be Mizuki. Toya\u2026 stared.</p><p>\"So you're Lil Bro's pal,\" she said.</p><p>Toya frowned. This was definitely Mizuki. She was probably older than him.</p><p>\"You beat us here,\" Rui said, ignoring her comment.</p><p>\"Rude.\" Mizuki made a face at Rui and crossed her arms. The frills on her shoulders fluttered with the motion. \"Aren't you gonna at least introduce us?\"</p><p>\"I'm Toya. You must be Mizuki,\" Toya cut in. \"Thank you for your assistance.\"</p><p>Mizuki was first taken aback, and then a smile spread across her face. \"Aw, you're so polite! That's so cute. Rui briefed you on the way here, correct? You'll have to do most of the heavy lifting, Lil Bro's buddy, but from your records you'll have no problem with that. Rui's job will be securing your path. I'll have to hang back a bit, but don't worry\u2013I'll keep an eye on you!\"</p><p>Mizuki winked and hefted what appeared to be a violin case higher on her shoulder. So she was a sniper.</p><p>\"Any sign of Junior?\" Rui asked.</p><p>All signs of mirth melted from Mizuki's face. \"No, but I'm sure this is the right place. I traced the car as far as it would go. So either he's still in the car, or he's in <i>there</i>.\"</p><p><i>There</i> was a plain looking building, a squat two floors, grey walls, probably awaiting demolition. There was no easy approach that'd let them in unseen. Not in the afternoon light.</p><p>\"Sure you don't wanna wait until evening?\" Mizuki asked. \"It's gonna be tough\u2013\"</p><p>\"No. No more waiting. If Akito's in there, I'm getting him out. It's my fault he's there.\"</p><p>Mizuki sighed and met Rui's eyes, but Rui just lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \"They might expect him later, but they don't expect anyone yet,\" he said.</p><p>\"Yeah, about that\u2026\" Mizuki frowned, and then pulled out a tablet. She angled it towards Rui, clearly not intending on showing Toya. Rui frowned as well, followed by a deep exhale.</p><p>\"When was this?\" Rui asked.</p><p>\"About ten minutes ago. The tablet is clever. They can remote wipe it and change the display as needed. No need to come back for\u2026 updates.\"</p><p>\"Please show me,\" Toya interrupted. \"If Akito was meant to be bait, then that is the hook. Please show it to me, I don't wish to be uninformed.\"</p><p>The two of them shared a silent conversation, and Toya watched as Rui angled his head towards him, followed by Mizuki's shrug of acceptance.</p><p>\"That's true enough,\" Mizuki said, handing the tablet to Rui. \"He's all yours.\"</p><p>\"Don't get a hot head,\" Rui warned him as he rapidly tapped the screen. He beckoned Toya closer, his mouth tightening.</p><p>That, Toya knew, as he stared down at the screen, was advice he'd find difficult to heed.</p><p>\"And then some instructions for you to go to a third place, unarmed and alone of course, but it's a decoy address as we expected,\" Rui said, turning the screen off once it was clear Toya had gotten a good look. \"I'm quite relieved I left the drone, this would have been much harder to manage if there were only the cameras.\"</p><p>\"Yup, you did good on that one!\" Mizuki chirped, jarringly cheerful. \"So now that we're all on the same page\u2013time for a rescue mission? Hey, you still with us, Lil Bro\u2013\"</p><p>\"Please call me Toya. And yes, I am listening.\"</p><p>\"Sorry, sorry. Right, you've got your work cut out for you. Doesn't look like they've got eyes outside, not yet at least. A couple guys left but aren't back yet. I\u2026 can kinda guess where they are.\"</p><p>\"How many inside?\" Rui interrupted.</p><p>\"No clue,\" Mizuki admitted. \"Looks like some sorta temporary headquarters thing, since their last one was\u2026\" She trailed off, glancing nervously at Toya. \"Anyway! They've gotta have some security cameras if it's a mid-term thing.\"</p><p>\"Cameras I can deal with,\" Rui said, waving away that particular concern. \"The rest's up to you, kid\u2013 Toya.\"</p><p>The image of Akito blindfolded and struggling to stand burned in his mind.</p><p>Don't get a hot head.</p><p>That was how mistakes were made.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\"Thank you both,\" he said, looking at each of them in turn. \"Your help has been indispensible.\"</p><p>Mizuki actually <i>cooed</i> while Rui sketched a bow.</p><p>\"Junior's safety is our primary concern,\" he said, serious and somber. It was somewhat undermined by Mizuki clapping her hands together in glee.</p><p>\"You're so well behaved! Oh, I <i>so</i> want to hug you but you hitmen type are always touchy about touch. I guess I'll put a rain check on that\u2013\"</p><p>\"Mizuki, I believe we were in the middle of something,\" Rui cut her off with a long suffering sigh, and an apologetic look towards Toya.</p><p>\"You're no fun,\" Mizuki huffed. \"But alright, let's do this. Just remember, rain check!\"</p><p>\"Akito comes first,\" Toya said, narrowing his eyes. \"Nothing else matters.\"</p><p>\"And there you have it,\" Rui said, gesturing graciously to Mizuki. \"Akito comes first. You and I, we have some groundwork to do. Did you bring what I asked?\"</p><p>\"Did you think I didn't?\" Mizuki countered, reaching into a pocket hidden in the folds of her skirt. She grabbed Toya's hand and dropped something in his palm before he could react. He was suddenly very glad she was on his side. She winked, like she'd read his mind, and tossed the same something to Rui who snatched it out of the air.</p><p>Toya looked at the earpiece in his hand. It seemed ordinary enough\u2013</p><p>\"It's nothing special,\" Rui admitted, fitting it into his ear. \"Just a few tweaks so it can't be intercepted, extra long battery life, a clear signal even through concrete\u2026\"</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, we get it, you're a genius inventor, the next Edison, all that. Now weren't you saying we had something to do?\" Mizuki had grabbed Rui's hand and was tugging him along. \"We're going on ahead\u2013we'll let you know when it's as clear as we can get it!\"</p><p>Toya watched, slightly speechless, as Mizuki waved at him cheerfully while leaving.</p><p>Akito came first.</p><p>Processing the past ten minutes came after.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>- - -</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Akito woke to the sound of gunfire.</p><p>\n  <i>Toya.</i>\n</p><p>His consciousness jerked awake, clinging to that one thought, but his body was slow and sluggish.</p><p>Chaos erupted. Someone screamed that someone was down, which made Akito smile in vicious glee. He tried to stand but his leg gave out with a sharp complaint of pain that left him gasping for breath.</p><p>\"Where the fuck is that coming from!?\"</p><p>\"Shit, outside?\"</p><p>\"There's\u2013<i>urk!</i>\"</p><p>Served him right.</p><p>A crowd of footsteps thundered down the stairs, and Akito realised with a sinking feeling that there were far more people than he'd thought. He could barely pick out words in the cacaphony of voices, of panic, of anger, of pain, of death, but it seemed that for the moment, he'd been forgotten.</p><p>And then:</p><p>\"What the\u2013<i>it's him!</i>\"</p><p>Toya.</p><p>\"Toya!\" The name tore itself from Akito's throat with a mind of its own, but it barely made a dent in the chaos.</p><p>Fuck, he wished he could <i>see</i>.</p><p>The sudden, unmistakable feeling of a gun pressed to his head. Oh. He probably shouldn't have yelled.</p><p>\"Move, and we shoot,\" Akito's captor hissed in the eerie silence that abruptly fell. \"Put your gun down.\"</p><p>\"Let him go,\" said a voice that Akito had learned to recognise anywhere. Except Toya's voice was cold, hard, <i>dangerous</i>. He'd been told that the day they'd met\u2013that this scared and beautiful boy was a dangerous man.</p><p>\"Your business is with me, not him,\" Toya said. \"Let him go, or you will regret it.\"</p><p>\"Ha! Regret? I take great <i>pleasure</i> in killing your lover in front of you, before\u2013\"</p><p>Whatever he'd been about to say was interrupted by the crack of a gun, and hot, wet viscera exploding against Akito's face. It tasted like blood. He tried not to think what it might be. The body toppled over onto him before falling to the floor, Akito crying out as the weight jarred his broken leg. The metallic clatter of the gun echoed in the sudden quiet.</p><p>\"Akito, are you alright?\"</p><p>Toya materialised beside him, and Akito nearly fainted in relief.</p><p>\"Been better,\" he said wryly.</p><p>Toya's soft laughter sent Akito's heart flying, and only then, did he accept his fear he'd never hear that laugh again.</p><p>The blindfold suddenly disappeared, and Toya appeared in his vision like the most fucking beautiful angel that had ever existed. He barely held back blurting out his first lizard brain thought, which could be summed up as <i>kiss me, and do it now</i>. His second wasn't any better: <i>fuck me please please please</i>.</p><p>\"Stay here,\" Toya said, before Akito had a chance to formulate actual words.</p><p>\"Like I can go anywhere,\" Akito muttered, but Toya was already gone, drawing the gunfire away from Akito.</p><p>The odds\u2026 didn't look good. Toya was beautiful and lethal and fast, but he was one against twenty.</p><p>One? Akito paused at the thought, as he watched a man fall from a bullet like a slow motion movie, except the bullet hadn't been fired by Toya. It'd come from outside. Toya had been smart, and brought help.</p><p>Akito couldn't look away. This was a dangerous man. There was no softness anywhere in his face, only grim determination and the promise of death in his eyes. Toya had been wearing a neat button-up shirt the first time they'd met. He was wearing one of Akito's t-shirts and one of Akito's jackets, and a pair of loose-fitting pants they'd bought not long after Toya had moved in, because none of Akito's pants were long enough. Toya moved like the wind, like he was a leaf carried by the river. Broken by the barest moments where his feet would catch against the floor, a millisecond of stillness where he marked his target and fired true, before he was gone, a bullet flying uselessly through the space he'd occupied an entire second ago.</p><p>He lost track of Toya briefly and panic threatened to fill his lungs. He looked around desperately, and he wasn't the only one who hadn't seen him duck into the shadow of a pillar to reload his guns, placing the spent cartridges carefully on the ground. It was the hair that Akito noticed. Again, he wasn't alone in noticing.</p><p>\"Over there! Bastard's hiding\u2013\"</p><p>Maybe he should've let Toya dye it.</p><p>He couldn't make out the brief grimace on Toya's face as a barrage of bullets struck worringly near. It subsided, but the moment Toya tried to shoot back, a lucky bullet grazed his arm and he had to pull back.</p><p>\"Toya\u2026\" Akito breathed like a prayer.</p><p>As if in answer:</p><p>Another shot from outside. But this one missed, bouncing off the floor\u2026</p><p>Bouncing?</p><p>Akito froze at the discrepency. A wall of smoke sprung up, cutting off his vision of Toya. Panic filled his lungs even though he knew it was friendly. It was drifting this way too and Akito squeezed his eyes shut and held his breath, but it wasn't thick like real smoke.</p><p>\"Sorry it took so long,\" Toya said softly, words brushing against his cheek. \"I wanted to come faster, but\u2013\"</p><p>Abandoning all caution, Akito turned and caught Toya in a hungry kiss, straining forward in his bonds, leaning heavily into the gentle touch against his shoulders, his waist. The moment of stiff surprise melted quickly, and Toya's breath shuddered into Akito's mouth. Time slowed, enveloped in the feeling of <i>Toya</i>.</p><p>\"You weren't supposed to come,\" Akito murmured, letting his head fall against Toya's shoulder.</p><p>\"Why was I not?\" Toya asked, and his confusion was so earnest it drew out a dry laugh.</p><p>\"Could've taken care of myself,\" Akito said, but it was all false bravado and they both knew it. Toya, to his credit, made no outward response. Instead, his hands slid up Akito's arms until his fingers alighted on his wrists, and the cuffs there. In a single unbelievably smooth motion, the cuffs clattered to the ground, and Akito's arms were brought gently down, his wrists instead encircled by Toya's delicate fingers.</p><p>\"Can you stand? No, of course not,\" Toya said, letting go of Akito's hands to unceremoniously sling him over his shoulder. Akito bit down on his lip, refusing to cry out when it jostled bruised ribs, but Toya seemed to sense it anyway.</p><p>\"'s fine,\" Akito said, cutting off the apology.</p><p>It wasn't, but time was of the essence right now.</p><p>The entire thing must've lasted seconds, from Toya surfacing in the smoke, to Toya gently placing him down behind a stack of boxes, but to Akito, it felt like several long minutes, supported in the safety of Toya's hands.</p><p>\"Can you stay here for some time? I need to make the exit safe before\u2013\"</p><p>\"Where'd you get the key? And d'you have the other?\" Akito blurted.</p><p>Toya looked down at the 'key' still in his hand, except it didn't look much like a key at all.</p><p>\"I only have one of these that Rui-san gave me, so you'll have to be patient,\" Toya said. He peeked out from the boxes. The smoke was starting to clear.</p><p>\"That purple haired weirdo!?\"</p><p>\"He was very helpful, Akito,\" Toya scolded. \"Now please wait and stay hidden. I promise I will be back soon.\"</p><p>Akito was left gaping after him, as Toya vanished into the remaining cover of the smoke bomb.</p><p>Well, he thought sourly, even if he had keys for his ankle restraints it wasn't like he could use his legs right now.</p><p>So Rui was here. If Rui was here, there was a good chance Mizuki was here, which meant that his sister was either behind this, or at least knew all about Akito's complete and utter humiliation. Goddammit. Mizuki told Ena <i>everything</i>. Or at least she used to, in those few years Akito lived at home.</p><p>Home.</p><p>His entire body fucking <i>hurt</i>.</p><p>Now that he was sitting, his arms by his side instead of wrenched painfully behind him, a bone-deep weariness threatened to smother him. It dampened the angry, panic voices and the tell-tale cracks of gunfire in a cotton-candy like grey fog. Yeah, it made sense if Mizuki was the one outside. Hopefully there wasn't anyone else.</p><p>So after all that, he'd be going back anyway, and putting Toya in danger all the same. All he had to do was go with Ena when she'd shown up yesterday afternoon\u2026 was that only yesterday?</p><p>Ah, damn. He didn't wanna think about how many bones were broken, but the answer was 'at least one'. He gingerly touched the side of his head and immediately regretted it, pulling his hand back with a wince. They were sticky, and Akito wasn't surprised to see through heavy eyelids that they were coated red. At least it wasn't all his.</p><p>Toya was better and stronger and more dangerous than any one of those fucking thugs. And he said he'd be back soon.</p><p>Toya was too good of a person to lie.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>- - -</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"I've got eyes on Junior.\" Rui's voice came through the earpieces, crystal clear. A drone hovered above him, hidden against the ceiling, the general noise of the kerfuffle hiding the sound of its propellers.</p><p>\"Thank you, Rui-san,\" Toya murmured quietly. He'd tucked himself behind a pillar, eyeing the next one he could take refuge behind after he took this shot.</p><p>\"You're quite welcome,\" Rui said. \"Poor kid's asleep again.\"</p><p>\"Aw, don't blame him, Lil Bro's been through a lot. Once we get him outta there he'll be sleeping even more, I'm sure,\" Mizuki said.</p><p>Toya smiled, took aim, fired three times, and was moving before the answering gunfire had a chance to find him.</p><p>\"I would appreciate more smoke, please,\" Toya said, crouching low.</p><p>\"Your wish is my command!\" Mizuki said cheerily.</p><p>\"Just the three left\u2013oh dear, someone is heading towards Junior.\"</p><p>\"I got it, focus on your things,\" Mizuki said, immediately serious.</p><p>Toya swallowed his trepidition and nodded. He was used to working alone and had been about to give up his position to protect Akito. Instead, he waited for Rui to give him the next target. There was more than one drone providing visual coverage.</p><p>A muted crack came through the earpiece.</p><p>\"Clear,\" Rui said, and the tension immediately eased in Toya's chest. \"Toya, thirty degrees right and fifteen up.\"</p><p>But not enough.</p><p>Toya took the shot, moved, and cupped a hand around the earpiece out of habit.</p><p>\"Everyone, I'd like to get Akito now. Mizuki-san, Rui-san, there are only three enemies remaining, correct? In this situation, if I were alone but had vision and cover, I would prefer to act.\" Toya knew he was being a bit forward, but he hoped they'd overlook it given the situation.</p><p>He peeked around the barrier but Mizuki's smoke bomb was thick, and chaos still roared. Mizuki was too far to take quick, accurate shots on moving targets, but noise was to Toya's asset, and that, she could provide. But he didn't need accurate here.</p><p>\"Unfortunately he moved, so yes, there are still three\u2013\"</p><p>\"That was a <i>lot</i> of words to say you're off to get the princess out of this tower. Go for it kiddo, Rui and I'll do what we can!\" Mizuki cut him off. Rui responded with a loud sigh.</p><p>\"Thank you, Mizuki-san, then I'll begin now.\"</p><p>Toya took a deep breath, orienting himself in the room. He saw Akito in his mind's eye\u2013sleeping, Rui had said. He'd bluffed a little, three hostiles were too risky to outrun in such close quarters. But he couldn't risk someone sneaking up on Akito again.</p><p>The smoke held thick. Toya broke out at a full sprint, cursing inwardly when he stumbled over something (or someone), the sound drawing attention.</p><p>\"Over here, bozos,\" Mizuki muttered to herself. A bullet exploded off something metal off to Toya's right.</p><p>\"Ignore it, that's a distraction, find him!\" someone yelled. \"You little fucker, we'll get you yet, with or without your pitiful friends.\"</p><p>Toya grimaced, back on his feet, this time stepping carefully over the body.</p><p>\"He's gotta be communicating with them somehow, listen for him,\" the same someone directed. The leader.</p><p>Keeping the layout firmly in his head, Toya inched forward. The newer drones could pick up infrared signals, Rui had said, but all he had right now was visual. In other words, he could make out what was at the bottom of the smoke as well as Toya could. Nothing for it, but slow and steady.</p><p>\"Mizuki, if you try a fraction to the left, you might manage more than just a distraction,\" Rui said. \"Careful not too much. Toya's there.\"</p><p>\"Roger that,\" Mizuki said.</p><p>It seemed an eternity before Toya made it to the nook where he'd stashed Akito. The smoke was thinner here, and although hazy, the sight of Akito's sleeping face sent a warm jolt through his chest.</p><p>\"Akito, I need to pick you up again,\" Toya said, as softly as he could manage. The problem was, given Akito's injuries, there was no good way to carry him. He ran his eyes over Akito's battered body. One leg looked better than the other, and his ribs were more damaged than his back. But if he carried Akito in his arms like that, he'd have no way to hold his gun.</p><p>That was fine. He holstered it. If he was careful, he wouldn't need to fire a single bullet.</p><p>He scooped Akito up as carefully as he could, one arm under his back and the other under his knees.</p><p><i>Princess carry</i>, a voice that sounded suspiciously like Mizuki's whispered in his brain.</p><p>Toya shoved it aside.</p><p>\"Ow\u2013Toya?\" Akito groaned, blinking his eyes open.</p><p>\"Shh,\" Toya said, even as a bullet buried itself harmlessly into some metal pillar. Worryingly nearby.</p><p>He crept carefully back the way he came, obstacles now included in his mental floor plan. Akito bit hard on his lip, face locked in a grimace.</p><p><i>Endure it a bit longer</i>, Toya thought desperately to Akito.</p><p>There was nothing over the communications either. They might've cut him off out of precaution, or were as tense as he was. Of the last few men standing, one had seized control, and it was eerily silent between the sound of bullets missing any human target and colliding with concrete or metal instead.</p><p>\"Here, boss! I've got it!\" one of the other two called, further away than Toya remembered them being.</p><p>\"<i>Shit</i>,\" Toya heard Rui hiss, just as a gust of wind pushed through the room. The room cleared.</p><p>So much for stealth.</p><p>Toya bolted.</p><p>Akito yelped, jolted by the sudden motion. Sounds didn't matter anymore. Toya glanced to his side, the smoke blown away and the bloody destruction he'd caused laid bare. It was a miracle he hadn't slipped earlier. Nor were all the bodies corpses\u2026 yet.</p><p>And then there were three, dangerous as ever.</p><p>\"Leaving so soon?\" the leader asked as he reloaded his gun. The empty cartridge clattered to the floor.</p><p>Toya made it behind one of the metal supports just as the first shot ran out. Akito's face was pale, his shirt clenched in his fists.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" Akito said, clearly not fine. Toya nodded anyway.</p><p>\"Three might've been too many after all,\" Toya admitted, pulling out his own gun.</p><p>\"They're moving too much for me,\" Mizuki said, apologetic. \"Otherwise I could cut the numbers.\"</p><p>A barrage of gunfire struck at and around their narrow shelter. Toya held Akito close with his free arm, shielding him with his body. It was no good. Every time he tried to get a shot, they pinned him back. And they were getting closer.</p><p>\"Hate to say it, but I don't think you can shoot your way out of this one,\" Rui said.</p><p>He was right. The only thing left was to run for it.</p><p>\"I'll send the drones in as distraction. I'll lose visual, but that should give you a few seconds. Take the pillar behind you and then move right. If Junior can hold a gun, a bit of firepower won't hurt,\" Rui instructed.</p><p>\"Can you hold a gun?\" Toya relayed to Akito.</p><p>\"He called me 'Junior' again didn't he,\" Akito muttered. He nodded, and Toya relinquished his gun. Akito was uncomfortably comfortable with it, but then again, he was the Shinonome son.</p><p>\"I've got shit aim,\" Akito warned at Toya's look.</p><p>Toya's lips twitched in a sad smile.</p><p>\"We're ready, Rui-san.\"</p><p>\"Roger that.\"</p><p>The drone made a sharp descent. Toya didn't wait to see if the distraction had worked. He caught Akito in his arms and took the path Rui had outlined. The irritated yells behind him of 'get that shit out of my face' died away too quickly.</p><p>He was at least ten seconds dead sprint away from the door, still slightly ajar.</p><p>They were <i>so</i> close.</p><p>\"Hey, you got this,\" Akito encouraged him quietly. He looked a mess, and Toya wished he had something to at least wipe the blood off his face.</p><p>\"Akito\u2026\"</p><p>\"Worrying's not gonna do shit right now,\" Akito said. \"So get that look off your face.\"</p><p>\"...\"</p><p>Akito reached up and brushed his fingers against Toya's cheek. They were calloused\u2013not from holding a gun, but from holding shovels and trowels and carrying buckets and trolleys. Toya clasped it in his own, clutching Akito tighter to himself.</p><p>\"Sounds like a touching moment, but with the drones out of commission I'm heading down to you, see if my aim's any better than Junior. Don't risk it\u2013\"</p><p>\"Sorry Rui-san, it seems like I will have to.\"</p><p>If he waited any longer, they'd surround him.</p><p>\"We may still have leftover pancakes,\" Toya mused, the thought frighteningly incongruent with the situation. Hopefully they'd get to eat them.</p><p>Toya launched himself out of hiding. Akito looped his arms around Toya's neck, and gamely fired off two shots that went wide. His breaths were sharp and ragged, each step jarring his battered ribs.</p><p>A sharp impact struck Toya in the back and he stumbled. Akito gasped, but Toya kept moving.</p><p>\"He's wearing a vest,\" someone yelled.</p><p>The next shot hit him in the leg.</p><p>Toya crashed to one knee, barely keeping Akito from falling to the ground. The sharp bruising impact of another bullet striking Rui's vest pushed the air out of his lungs. He hunched over Akito, gasping.</p><p>\"Toya!\"</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" Toya grunted, struggling back to his feet. His leg hurt, but he could move.</p><p>Too late, Toya registered the man coming between him and the door\u2013between Akito and the door. Too late, he registered the man's gun. He pivoted, shielding Akito with his body. This close, it burned through his shoulder, and Toya's arm went momentarily limp. If Akito hadn't been clinging to his neck he would've fallen. But he was, and he hadn't, and maybe Akito was a better shot than he said he was, or he was just lucky, because his shot caught the man straight in his chest.</p><p>And that man wasn't wearing a vest.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Toya managed. They were so close.</p><p>\"Don't mention it,\" Akito said wryly. \"Save your breath.\"</p><p>Toya's lips twitched in a smile. He forced his arm to move, to hold Akito to him. The smell of blood was strong. So strong.</p><p>It was his own blood.</p><p>They were running toward him, firing wildly. Toya counted the bullets out of habit even as he forced himself forward. One still struck him in the thigh, nearly causing him to overbalance.</p><p>Akito, to his credit, at least drew blood.</p><p>Two left.</p><p>He was moving too slowly. He wasn't going to make it.</p><p>One shot struck unnervingly close to his neck, and another in his other leg sent Toya sprawling, as he held Akito as well as he could, but he couldn't stop Akito from slamming into the floor.</p><p>No other choice. Two bullets left. Two hostiles left.</p><p>Toya pulled the gun from Akito's slack grip. Rolled over. Breathe in. Pulled the trigger. Breathe out. Pulled the trigger. Bad shots, but enough to stop their pursuit. For now.</p><p>He looked down. Akito had passed out again, but he was breathing. They had to get out now.</p><p>Toya stumbled into daylight just as tires screeched to a stop in front of him. He looked up in alarm, but it was only Rui. Panic was a strange look on this stranger's face.</p><p>Wordlessly, Rui slung an unconscious Akito over one shoulder and supported Toya with the other after hauling him to his feet. Two meters had never felt so long. The bullets in his leg burned, and the hole in his shoulder was bleeding more than it should. When had he gotten so weak? This\u2026 this was nothing.</p><p>He would've been ashamed that he'd lost consciousness by the time Rui pushed him into the car\u2013if he remembered it at all.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>- - -</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Welcome home.\" Ena had greeted him with crossed arms and irritation the first time Akito surfaced from anesthesia. That had been days ago.</p><p>\"She is giving you time to rest,\" Toya said. He leaned back in the chair that'd been installed by Akito's bed. A pile of books covered the small table, with the exception of a mug sized corner claimed by a coaster that more often than not was occupied than a cup of coffee.</p><p>\"You're sure they're not drugging me?\" Akito asked, eyes narrowing.</p><p>\"Akito.\" Toya shut the book he was reading and levelled a flat look in his direction.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, the concussion, I know,\" Akito grumbled. Already he felt his eyes closing. He'd flat out refused the stronger painkillers, pissed at how they put him to sleep. Apparently his own fucking head had different ideas.</p><p>\"It isn't just the concussion,\" Toya reminded him gently. \"Your body needs time and energy to heal, and the best way to do that is rest.\"</p><p>\"Then how come you're not resting?\" Akito sniped back like he always did.</p><p>Toya just sighed.</p><p>He knew how Akito chafed at the inactivity, but he also saw the undercurrent of worry and anxiety that plagued both his waking and sleeping hours. He'd decided not to tell Akito of the nightmares.</p><p>They'd given Toya his own room across the hall from Akito's. From what he gathered, this wasn't really Akito's <i>home</i>, but rather a bustling complex that Mizuki had told him was \"like a college campus, but more fun!\" She'd been a great help in the past few days, dropping in to check on him and Akito whenever she could. Other than the doctor and his assistant, Toya hadn't met anyone else. It was probably intentional.</p><p>No, that wasn't quite correct.</p><p>Akito had drifted off into that state of half-sleep he so often occupied. Toya wished he'd allow himself to sleep, truly sleep, but that would've been very unlike Akito.</p><p>He wondered if he should tell Akito of the morning's visitor.</p><p>\"So you're Toya.\"</p><p>Toya had jerked up at the unfamiliar voice. It'd taken him a second too long to recognise this man as Akito and Ena's father\u2013as the head of the Shinonome family.</p><p>\"No, sit,\" he'd said, as Toya scrambled for his crutches. He'd meekly sank back down, an apology on his tongue.</p><p>Akito was fast asleep.</p><p>\"I suppose I should thank you for saving my son,\" the head of the Shinonome family said, regarding his unconscious son with a critical look.</p><p>\"It was my fault,\" Toya blurted out. \"I\u2013\"</p><p>\"No. If there is fault, then it is Ena's for being careless, and his for being foolish. You are simply the cost for doing business,\" he'd said, and left.</p><p>The cost for doing business.</p><p>Toya grabbed his crutches and hauled himself to his feet. The doctor thought he could trade it for a walking stick soon, impressed at how quickly Toya's body was knitting together torn flesh and muscle. And he needed to give his shoulder a rest. He was lucky he'd mostly escaped with just bruises.</p><p>He looked down at Akito, finally asleep. The same couldn't be said for him.</p><p>\"It could have been worse,\" Mizuki had said one quiet evening, uncharacteristically serious. \"He's lucky to have you.\"</p><p>Toya had flushed, words caught unformed in his throat.</p><p>\"They were going to sell him off if you hadn't showed, and going through that again, I think\u2026 it would have broken him for good,\" Mizuki had said. \"There was no reason for you to stay for him.\"</p><p>\"Akito saved me,\" Toya said. \"I couldn't\u2013\"</p><p>\"No, you could've,\" Mizuki cut him off. \"Ena was wrong to threaten you\u2013to threaten him with you. I wouldn't blame you for running. She didn't think you would, and she didn't think he would either if it'd put you at risk. She cares for Akito more than she lets on, y'know? She knows him better than he thinks.\"</p><p>\"You know Ena-san very well, Mizuki-san,\" Toya noted.</p><p>\"Ahaha\u2026 well, I try! Anyway! I almost forgot! I brought cookies from dinner. They were outta choco-chip but the almond ones aren't bad. Go on, have a try, before Lil Bro wakes up and hogs them all.\"</p><p>So much had happened in the past few days. Every time he tried to gather his spinning thoughts, something new would blow the entire thing into disarray. But Toya hadn't lived the life that'd been torn away for very long.</p><p>Not like Akito.</p><p>Toya shook his head, as if it would jostle things into place. Akito was sleeping. He should get some sleep too. In his own bed. It was why he'd gotten to his feet. But looking down at Akito's still form, the dread of losing him hooked its talons into Toya's chest and drew him back down like a compulsion.</p><p>He couldn't leave Akito alone.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>He grabbed another book from the pile, but decided to rest his eyes for a moment first. Just a moment.</p><p>\"Hey. Go sleep in bed.\"</p><p>Toya blinked his eyes open to Akito peering very closely at his face. He rubbed his eyes, frowning lightly.</p><p>\"What are you doing out of bed?\" he asked, voice hoarse from sleep.</p><p>\"Being human,\" Akito said flatly. \"Nature called.\"</p><p>\"Ah.\"</p><p>Akito rested the borrowed crutches back within Toya's reach and settled himself with difficulty back in bed. He had to close his eyes for a moment and catch his breath.</p><p>Toya's hand found his, and he opened his eyes as Toya sank down onto the bed by Akito's side. Concern filled Toya's clear, grey eyes, sending a sharp pang of guilt stabbing through Akito's chest. He interlaced their fingers in a loose grasp.</p><p><i>Sleep in your own bed</i>, Akito wanted to say, but he suddenly wanted Toya to be much closer than across the hall. In a half-remembered haze, he heard Mizuki tell Toya <i>\"you're very hard to read, y'know? Show some more emotion!\"</i> Akito had tried to fight through the drowsiness to correct Mizuki that Toya wasn't hard to read at all, Mizuki just sucked at it, but neither his eyes nor tongue had wanted to obey him.</p><p>\"Don't worry so much,\" Akito said without thinking.</p><p>Toya's eyes opened slightly in surprise, before his expression softened.</p><p>\"I'm not worrying,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't lie,\" Akito said, corner of his mouth twitching. \"You're a terrible liar.\"</p><p>A myriad of thoughts flit across Toya's face, each one reflected clearly in his eyes.</p><p>\"You're right as usual, Akito,\" Toya finally said, with a quiet smile of acknowledgement. \"A lot has happened.\"</p><p>\"No fucking shit,\" Akito muttered. Toya laughed, his grasp tightening with the motion.</p><p>\"It's been a very eventful few days. It's hard for me not to worry,\" Toya admitted.</p><p>Akito shuffled over to the far side of the bed. He tugged at Toya's hand, and after a moment of hesitation, Toya kicked off his slippers and lay down by Akito's side, the warmth of his body a cocoon of safety.</p><p>\"Yeah, well you can't do anything about any of it,\" Akito said. \"And before you get on <i>my</i> case, I pass out before I can even form a thought. Hard to worry like that.\"</p><p>Toya didn't need to know about the ball of anxiety that had settled permanently in his gut, a knotted ball of yarn weighted with a stone. He had a feeling Toya knew, anyway.</p><p>As if in answer to the unspoken thought, Toya brushed his thumb over Akito's, a quiet reassurance.</p><p>Akito exhaled, and turned his head to find Toya watching him with what would've been an unnerving intensity, had Akito not grown used to it. It seemed strange to Akito how no one noticed how much Toya <i>felt</i>. How much of himself Toya threw into everything.</p><p>Akito couldn't help it. He rolled onto his side, ignoring his screaming ribs, and kissed him.</p><p>Toya's breath met his in the space between their lips.</p><p>\"Smells like coffee,\" Akito murmured, pulling back just far enough to see confusion twinkle in Toya's clear grey eyes.</p><p>\"But I'm not drinking coffee right now,\" Toya said.</p><p>\"I'm talking about <i>you</i>,\" Akito said, bridging the space between them again. \"You always taste like coffee.\"</p><p>Toya's lips parted easily to let Akito kiss into his mouth, their tongues touching, their breaths mingling. Toya was hesitant, unsure if this was hurting Akito\u2013but Akito was an adult, he firmly reminded himself, as Akito rolled on top of him.</p><p>Toya brushed loose strands of hair away from Akito's eyes. The edges of an ugly bruise extended just past his temple, and Toya took care not to touch it. Akito was equally careful not to rest his weight on Toya's leg.</p><p>So much had happened. There was so much to worry about. But there was also Akito kissing him hungrily, like a man dying of thirst yearning for water, like a frightened man holding tight to a vanishing illusion. But Toya was no illusion, and Toya clutched his arm and kissed him back just as desperately.</p><p>He was sure\u2013he wanted to spend the rest of his life with this man.</p><p>They pulled apart for air, neither of them having the stamina to do much more than stare into each other's eyes. The air seemed still, breath snatched from their lungs.</p><p>\"Toya\u2013\"</p><p>\"What the fuck Akito, couldn't you at least lock the door!? Ugh, I need to unsee that.\"</p><p>Toya's wide eyes matched Akito's as Ena suddenly appeared in the doorway. Accompanied by Mizuki.

His outstretched arm hits conspicuously empty space, and the blanket is cold when he slides his arm upwards. He remembers waking earlier in a sleep haze, but it\u2019d been dark and gray outside and Sungyeol had been pulled back down under the blankets, told to go back to sleep. It\u2019s still early, early enough that his weekend alarm has yet to go off. </p><p>He lies there for a few more minutes, awake, toeing the boundary of a new day. It\u2019s tempting to burrow under the covers, but it\u2019s not something he can put off forever, and eventually he does crawl to the edge of the bed and swings himself upright. The blood rushes from his head, and he groans as he stands, vision temporarily black. The carpet is soft against his bare feet as he shuffles to the kitchen\u2014the tile there is a cool shock. </p><p>He\u2019s awake. </p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Sungyeol grumbles. He leans against the wall, rubs at his eyes with the back of his hand. </p><p>Woohyun turns from the stove, spatula still in hand. He\u2019s there as if he belongs, as if it\u2019s normal for him to fit into this picture, at Sungyeol\u2019s stove, in Sungyeol\u2019s kitchen. He breaks into that annoying shit eating grin when he sees Sungyeol standing there. </p><p>\"Making breakfast, obviously,\" he says. </p><p>Obviously. There\u2019s a plate stacked with pancakes, and batter still in the mixing bowl. Woohyun\u2019s gone back to ignoring him, focussing his attention towards the stove. Sungyeol grimaces at his back for a good second. </p><p>\"Who asked you to do that?\" he snaps. He reaches around around Woohyun for the dishcloth, aggressively wiping the thin patches of flour that\u2019ve spilled on the counter. </p><p>\"Well look who\u2019s a ray of sunshine,\" Woohyun hums. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s rolled out of bed and he\u2019s still wearing what he\u2019d slept in, and it\u2019s a stark difference next to Woohyun, fully dressed, button down shirt and neat jeans and socks and all. He flips the pancake, one sharp movement of his wrist, and Sungyeol mentally curses him for being able to do everything so god damned perfectly. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll make coffee.\" It\u2019s one smell that\u2019s conspicuously missing, one gap that he can fill. </p><p>Woohyun makes a sound that's probably agreement, or maybe even some sort of thanks. </p><p>\"And why pancakes?\" Sungyeol adds. There\u2019s a faint hint of desperation rising inside him, and it makes no sense, and he pushes it back down. \"We could\u2019ve just had cereal, I don\u2019t\u2014\" </p><p>\"You can have cereal again if you don\u2019t want it,\" Woohyun says. He grins cheekily at him, the one that borders a smirk, and slides the last one onto the plate. </p><p>\"God, this makes it feel like we\u2019re boyfriends or something,\" Sungyeol says, and for a brief moment, the smile slips from Woohyun\u2019s face. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t take the bait\u2014what bait?\u2014only reaches for more plates. </p><p>They settle down for breakfast in near silence, Sungyeol carrying the coffee, Woohyun bringing the food. His hair is pushed back from his face, and it\u2019s a soft brown, and he looks less young. The food is good, like always, and Sungyeol shovels it into his mouth, while Woohyun cuts it into neat pieces, eating methodically. </p><p>He kicks Woohyun under the table, and Woohyun\u2019s eyes flicker up in surprise. </p><p>\"What was that for?\" he says. </p><p>\"For being annoying,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Wow, look who\u2019s talking.\" Woohyun scoffs, and kicks him back\u2014only it has no heat in it, and ends with Woohyun sliding his socked foot up Sungyeol\u2019s shin. Woohyun\u2019s eyes are steady, and Sungyeol jerks his leg away, and Sungyeol buries his face in his coffee. </p><p>\"Well,\" Woohyun says, scraping back his chair. His plate is empty. \"I better be going. I cooked, so you get the dishes.\" </p><p>\"I knew I\u2019d be cleaning up your mess,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun laughs, loud and obnoxious as always. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t miss me too much,\" he says, as he heads for the door. </p><p>Sungyeol stands as well. It doesn\u2019t feel right, Woohyun letting himself out like that, even if he has before, and even if he could. He watches as Woohyun grabs his bag, his coat, his new scarf, Sungyeol hovering as Woohyun puts on his shoes. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, as Woohyun opens the door. </p><p>\"Yeah.\" </p><p>Sungyeol isn\u2019t thinking\u2014Sungyeol pushes the door shut, before it\u2019s barely had a chance to click open. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s mouth opens in surprise. Sungyeol grabs Woohyun by the shirt, pulling him close, crushing their mouths together. His things fall to the floor with a quiet thump. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s tongue slips between Woohyun\u2019s parted lips, and he catches his lip between tongue and teeth. His other hand slides up Woohyun\u2019s back, cupping the back of Woohyun\u2019s neck. Woohyun\u2019s mouth is hot against his, and his body is hot against him. The heat floods his body, floods his mind. There\u2019s the unmistakable bulge pressing against his thigh, as Woohyun slowly regains his senses and kisses him back. Sungyeol moans into his mouth, and the door is far from soundproof, but he doesn\u2019t care. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s lips are wet and slick when Sungyeol draws back just enough to take a deep breath, and this time, he uses a bit more teeth than necessary, and there\u2019s a quiet hiss as Woohyun pulls away. His face is flushed\u2014Sungyeol\u2019s own chest is tight, his head dizzying with a need for air. </p><p>Woohyun fingers dig into Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, and in a flash, he turns their positions, pushing Sungyeol against the door, his back thudding hard against it. Woohyun says nothing, but he doesn\u2019t need to, just kisses Sungyeol hungrily. Sungyeol whines, grinding up against Woohyun with need. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s body is flushed with heat, and Woohyun\u2019s tongue is in his mouth, exploring it as if he\u2019s never done this before. One of his hands slip under Sungyeol\u2019s tank, and it\u2019s pressed between them, palm against his chest. Woohyun smells of shampoo and the faded scent of detergent. He holds Sungyeol down, even as Sungyeol tries to pull away for air. </p><p>His fingers bruise against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and Sungyeol shoves, really shoves, gasping. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s eyes are sharp. </p><p>He\u2019s breathing hard too, his chest rises and falls as fast as his heart is beating, and his lips are red and wet. </p><p>And then Woohyun\u2019s mouth is hot against his skin. </p><p>\"Ahh\u2014\" </p><p>The heat of pleasure shoots through Sungyeol, Woohyun sucking at the side of his neck, his mouth a tight seal, and fuck, he bares his neck, fuck, he feels like he could come right now, just from Woohyun\u2019s mouth, like this\u2014It\u2019s a good thing Woohyun\u2019s so much shorter than him\u2014the thought flits through his mind, but then Woohyun\u2019s kissing down the line of his jaw, and Sungyeol grasps at the back of Woohyun\u2019s shirt, fabric bunching between his fingers. His tongue flickers against his skin, and then his mouth is at the crook of his neck, and god, fuck, it feels so good and Sungyeol already knows it\u2019s going to leave a mark, and it\u2019s hot, hot, hot and Sungyeol clings to him, knowing he\u2019s whining, knowing the sounds that slip out of his open mouth are as incoherent as sounds can be, but he knows that it\u2019s filled with as much need as he feels. Woohyun\u2019s palm still pins Sungyeol against the door, and Sungyeol grounds himself in that. </p><p>\"I\u2026\" </p><p>\"Mmm,\" Woohyun hums. It rings against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and then there\u2019s teeth closing around it\u2014and then his hand has slipped beneath the elastic of Sungyeol\u2019s shorts, fingers brushing against the head of Sungyeol\u2019s cock through his underwear. </p><p>His world explodes. He buries his face against Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, cries muffled in his shirt. Fuck, it isn\u2019t that he\u2019s missed this, it\u2019s that\u2014everything narrows down to Woohyun\u2019s fingers playing against him, and his senses are flooded with the sensation of touch, and each moment sends sharp shockwaves through his bones. </p><p>Sungyeol comes down with a quiet moan, his muscles falling slack, as he wraps his arms around Woohyun\u2019s chest. </p><p>Woohyun steps away, and Sungyeol nearly falls. </p><p>\"Have a good day,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>His hair is mussed, falling over his eyes, his shirt rumpled and untucked.  </p><p>Sungyeol presses a hand against his neck, and watches him go.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><hr /><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s raining, in that incessant way it does, every other year in the join between winter and spring, spring and summer. Sungyeol wanders between the windows and his desk, willing it to lighten, half heartedly doing work in the meantime. It\u2019s wet and gray and nearing six. The office is far from empty, but Sungyeol prefers to come in early to avoid the morning rush. The city, through the rain speckled windows, is muted, some six floors below. It\u2019s also a steady stream of black umbrellas, sweeping towards the entrance of the underground pathway. The office itself is its usual gray cubicle walls and ugly purple-green carpet, and it seems to match the mood outside. He catches more than a few screens with discreetly open windows of Youtube and Facebook; he makes scoffing faces at the backs of the owners, faking being hard at work. Well, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s never been guilty of the same. He drops back into his seat, kicking at the edge of the desk in frustration. There\u2019s a noise of irritation on the other side of the divider, and Sungyeol says a sheepish sorry. </p><p>His phone lights up with a text. </p><p><tt>wanna come over?</tt> </p><p>It sits in his hand for a moment, and then Sungyeol drops it as if it burns. </p><p>It sits on the table for a moment, the screen flickering black but the notification light blinking like an accusation. Sungyeol picks it up. </p><p><tt>no</tt> he shoots back. </p><p><tt>pity :(</tt> The reply comes almost immediately. Sungyeol\u2019s ready to send a suitably scathing text back when another message pops up again.  </p><p><tt>sure? kibum\u2019s gonna be here too. just to chill.</tt> </p><p>The thing about friendships was that it was easier to break them than it was to pick them back up. <i>We won\u2019t be alone</i>, is what Woohyun means. <i>It won\u2019t be like last time. The last few times.</i> </p><p>Chance meetings, and it\u2019s impossible to pretend not to know each other, and it\u2019s maybe more impossible to pretend they don\u2019t want to try, to cobble back together something that resembles friendship. Icy silences, a dance between two people eager to avoid the other, but equally eager to attempt it, like the adults they were instead of the kids they\u2019d been. That Sungyeol had been. </p><p>Sungyeol shoves his phone into his bag. The rain doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be ending any time soon. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s in any hurry to get home\u2014it\u2019s nice, living alone, but sometimes it\u2019s a little quiet, a little empty. Maybe he should get a dog. He keeps thinking about that. </p><p>Woohyun lives two subway stops away, the awkward distance where he should walk, but at the same time, just far enough that it could be justified, especially when he has a monthly pass, and there\u2019s no point in not using it. It\u2019s raining, but maybe it\u2019s better that way. </p><p>\"I thought you weren\u2019t coming?\" Woohyun says. There\u2019s a wicked glint in his eyes, once the brief flash of surprise has melted into his signature smile.  </p><p>\"Has anyone told you you\u2019re insufferable lately?\" Sungyeol asks. Woohyun takes his umbrella and the beer, and Sungyeol shoves past him, kicking his shoes off into the tangled pile, the ankles of his pants uncomfortably wet from where the umbrella was no help. </p><p>\"Look who\u2019s talking,\" Woohyun laughs. </p><p>It\u2019s a nice apartment, and a familiar one, all sleek and wooden floors and modern. The kitchen\u2019s a little on the small side, but that just means a bigger living room. Sungyeol rakes his eyes over everything that hasn\u2019t changed, the large TV, the fold out couch, Sunggyu\u2019s laptop under the coffee table, displaced by a large bowl of chips, a mix of ketchup and regular. The door to the bathroom is next to the kitchen, and next to Woohyun\u2019s room. It\u2019s a little smaller than Sunggyu\u2019s master bedroom, but still big enough for a full sized bed and a desk. The door\u2019s half open, but the lights are off. Sunggyu and Dongwoo have settled themselves on the floor, and are beating the shit out of each other on Sunggyu\u2019s old N64, and Kibum is there, as promised, perched on the side of the couch and cheering them both on. </p><p>\"Glad you could show up,\" Kibum says. </p><p>Dongwoo turns to shoot him a happy grin, but then Sunggyu combos him and he\u2019s back to the screen, shocked that Sunggyu was playing dirty. </p><p>\"Who\u2019s winning?\" Sungyeol asks. He throws himself onto the couch next to Kibum, grabbing a handful of chips and shoving them into his mouth.  Woohyun is putting the beer Sungyeol had brought into the fridge.  </p><p>\"Three to two,\" Kibum says, just as Sunggyu ends it with a final attack, and Dongwoo\u2019s character flies off the stage. Kibum raises his eyebrows. \"Four to two,\" he amends. Dongwoo whines over losing in the background, head thrown back as he laughs.  </p><p>\"Anyone want to take over?\" Dongwoo leans back, offering the controller. </p><p>Kibum takes it, and slides down to where Dongwoo had been sitting. Dongwoo greets Sungyeol warmly, before literally skipping off to the kitchen to help Woohyun with whatever it was he was doing. </p><p>\"Long time no see,\" Sunggyu says. \"When\u2019s the last time you were here?\" </p><p>\"I knew you\u2019d missed me,\" Sungyeol says, making a heart with his hands. </p><p>\"Woohyun\u2019s rubbing off on you,\" Sunggyu says. Kibum\u2019s done selecting his character, and they both hit start. </p><p>Sungyeol watches two rounds, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to which of them are the loudest, Sungyeol included, before Woohyun interrupts them. He leans forward against Sungyeol, arms dangling over his shoulders, like he always (had always) does. </p><p>\"Hate to interrupt,\" he says cheerily, in a matter that says he doesn\u2019t at all, \"but any pizza requests?\" </p><p>\"Meat,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs Woohyun off, but Woohyun clings like a leech. </p><p>\"Hawaiian,\" Kibum tosses out, furiously mashing buttons. </p><p>\"And cheese as usual? Got it,\" Woohyun says. He finally pulls away, his touch still searing against Sungyeol\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"Should we switch to Smash after this round?\" Dongwoo suggests. \"Since there\u2019s more of us here now.\" </p><p>\"Extra controllers in my room!\" Woohyun calls out, holding the phone away from his face for a brief moment. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll go get it,\" Sungyeol says, already jumping over the back of the couch. He runs into the open door on the right, then fumbles in the dark room for a moment for the switch. It takes a few seconds, but he finds it eventually. </p><p>Sunggyu was right. It\u2019s been a while since the last time he\u2019s been over. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s room hasn\u2019t changed much, not that Sungyeol would\u2019ve expected it to. Bed on the right, closet on the left, desk a little messier than it usually is, which means work\u2019s probably been busy. He pulls open the closet. It\u2019s where Woohyun keeps most of his things, the ones that don\u2019t go anywhere else. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t notice, rummaging through the boxes, that there\u2019s someone behind him until Woohyun\u2019s hand is on his shoulder. </p><p>\"Fuck, you scared me,\" Sungyeol hisses. </p><p>Woohyun presses his lips together, then joins Sungyeol in unearthing them from the bottom of the box. </p><p>\"Stay?\" Woohyun asks. It\u2019s quiet, and so petulant that Sungyeol nearly scoffs. </p><p>\"I\u2019d better not,\" Sungyeol says. He stands, controller in hand, cable trailing behind him. Woohyun is still crouched down. There\u2019s a sigh as he follows Sungyeol out into the living room, the other controller in his hand. </p><p>Sungyeol should\u2019ve left first, or second. Probably should\u2019ve stood and gone when Kibum did, citing work tomorrow morning. He didn\u2019t, though, and then it was just him, Sunggyu, and Woohyun. </p><p>\"Are you staying over?\" Sunggyu asks. </p><p>He didn\u2019t know, Woohyun had told him once. </p><p>\"I probably shouldn\u2019t,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>He\u2019s had two and a half beers, the half because he\u2019d stolen it from Woohyun. Alcohol tends to mellow him out, and it doesn\u2019t take much. Myungsoo likes to jibe at him that he\u2019s much better that way, much easier to deal with.  </p><p>\"It\u2019s still raining,\" Woohyun says, and it\u2019s true. If anything, the rain\u2019s gotten heavier. Then: \"I\u2019ve still got the sleeping bag.\" </p><p>Sungyeol had used it once. Then Woohyun had said his bed was big enough, and it made more sense. It wouldn\u2019t have been the first time, especially not since undergrad, too many people crowded into one room and empty bottles of alcohol stashed into trash bags they\u2019ll take out in the morning, but. And. </p><p>Woohyun, against the wall; Myungsoo, curled up against him; Sungyeol, sandwiched between them, too hot, and too aware of them both. </p><p>Sungyeol, against the wall; Woohyun half on top of him. </p><p>Woohyun\u2014 </p><p>They\u2019d been young. </p><p>\"I\u2019m heading to bed,\" Sunggyu says. He stands, and nods at Sungyeol. </p><p>\"It\u2019s not even eleven,\" Woohyun points out. \"Someone\u2019s getting old.\" </p><p>Sunggyu glares at him, his narrow eyes all but disappearing. \"I\u2019m only two years older\u2014and show some respect, kiddo.\" </p><p>\"Yes <i>hyung</i>,\" Woohyun says, at the same time Sungyeol laughs and says \"whatever, grandpa.\" </p><p>Sunggyu grumbles and disappears into the bathroom as Woohyun and Sungyeol high five each other, mumbling about disrespectful brats. </p><p>\"I do still have the sleeping bag,\" Woohyun says, after a moment. The silence has fallen back into the empty spaces, broken by the occasional sounds of running water. </p><p>Sungyeol hesitates. It\u2019s not even eleven, like Woohyun had said, and he doesn\u2019t live that far from here, rain or no. Five subway stops and a fifteen minute walk, if the busses weren\u2019t running by the time he got to his station. Not ideal, but he should. </p><p>Should and did, though, were very different things.  </p><p>\"Alright,\" he says. \"But I\u2019ll take the sleeping bag.\" </p><p>Woohyun nods, and disappears to pull it out from under the bed. Sungyeol waits a beat, then trails into the room behind him. There\u2019s a loose t-shirt and pair of shorts on the bed. </p><p>\"Unless you want to sleep in your work clothes,\" Woohyun says, when he notices Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I could\u2019ve slept in no clothes,\" Sungyeol says. He regrets it immediately. He snatches up the clothes before Woohyun can say anything, and turns around to change. </p><p>\"Nothing I haven\u2019t seen before,\" Woohyun murmurs from behind him. </p><p>A flush of embarrassment cascades down his skin. </p><p>He takes longer than he needs, unbuttoning his shirt, then pulling the t-shirt over his head faster than he usually does. When he turns around again, Woohyun is also changed. </p><p>\"Hyung\u2019s out of the bathroom, if you want it first,\" Woohyun says. \"Since you always complain I take too long.\" </p><p>\"Because you <i>do</i>,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Your spare toothbrush is still in the cabinet!\" Woohyun calls out from behind him. Sunyeol\u2019s pulse skips a beat in surprise. </p><p>It\u2019s been months\u2014but more than that, why hadn\u2019t he thrown it out, already? </p><p>\"Is it still safe to use?\" He shoots back. Sunggyu yells at them to keep it down through the closed door, and Sungyeol ignores him. </p><p>Woohyun just laughs at them both. </p><p>Woohyun does take forever, because he\u2019d clean his face twice, then spend at least fifteen minutes gently patting in who knew what serums or lotions or whatever onto his face. Sungyeol had watched him once, perched on the seat of the toilet. He\u2019d stalked off in frustration when it seemed like it\u2019d never end. </p><p>By the time Woohyun returns, hair damp from the shower and skin faintly glowing, Sungyeol has already rolled himself into the sleeping bag, his phone plugged into the wall with Woohyun\u2019s stolen charger. </p><p>\"You\u2019re sure?\" Woohyun asks. His voice is quiet, soft. Uncertain. For a moment, Sungyeol wonders who else has seen him like this\u2014who else\u2019s made him like this.  </p><p>Sungyeol answers by burying himself deeper into the sleeping bag. </p><p>He hears Woohyun sigh, and turn off the lights. </p><p>Sungyeol wakes partway through the night\u2014the rain has stopped, but through the half open blinds, the light of the city still glints from the lingering drops of water. He reaches blearily for his phone. In the pale blue glow of the screen, he sees Woohyun sleeping on the far side of the bed, the left side of the bed conspicuously empty. </p><p>Sungyeol switches off his phone, and tugs the sleeping bag over his head.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The first time Sungyeol sees Woohyun, the latter is at the front of the classroom, the first day of his Introductory Macroeconomics class. Way too young to be a professor, kind of cute, especially with those glasses\u2014but then Sungyeol discovers, loudly, that Woohyun isn\u2019t even a year older than him. </p><p>Some of the upper year students are less than pleased. </p><p>Him and Woohyun, they didn't quite get along. </p><p>(Sungyeol tends to pretend not to remember the end of that term, when they get into a yelling match in front of the entire class. He starts that one too.) </p><p>The first time Sungyeol sees Woohyun as a person, not stuck up lecturer with a chip on his shoulder, is in line at the coffee shop near the library. He\u2019s wearing a grey cardigan, hair falling over his eyes, and with the hallowed look of someone who hadn't slept in days. It\u2019s midterms, and Sungyeol\u2019s not surprised. He's staring at his phone, fingers listlessly tapping at the screen, a handful of change in his other hand. </p><p>Sungyeol opens his mouth, a sharp comment on the tip of his tongue. He doesn't. He leans back against the glass wall, hands shoved into his pockets, and watches Woohyun place his order, handing the cashier the exact change he\u2019d already picked out. A medium coffee, and bagel, toasted with butter. Sungyeol knows the drill. But it's when Woohyun turns, sliding his phone back into his pocket, and his eyes meet Sungyeol\u2019s\u2014for a split second, he freezes, and the line of tension running through his body is almost visible. </p><p>Sungyeol opens his mouth, and then closes it, but then Woohyun breaks out into a grin and says: \"are you stalking me?\" </p><p>\"Who\u2019d want to stalk <i>you</i>,\" Sungyeol snaps, and fuck that, he was an annoying piece of shit.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The office is nearly empty, the clock pushing seven. </p><p>Some of the lights have already flickered off, detecting no movement in good portions of the floor. Those that remain act as a spotlight, islands of after hours productivity, or non productivity.  </p><p>In Sungyeol\u2019s case, it\u2019s the latter.  </p><p>He leans back in his chair, elbows resting lightly on its arms, his fingers steepled. The smell of bagels, toasted with butter, flits through his memories, one well remembered from his university days. It\u2019s been a long time since then, and he\u2019s no longer a cash strapped time strapped student, bouncing between classes, tutorials, and the library.  </p><p>Hectic, horrible, stressed, terrified. Nerve wracking, might\u2019ve been the better way to put it. So he hadn\u2019t been the greatest student, hadn\u2019t spent as much time in the library as he should\u2019ve, but the fear of failure had always been there, as much as it\u2019d been for anyone else. He doesn\u2019t miss it, but at the same time, he does. Every assignment, every test, every paper, every exam\u2014all it took was one bad day, and it\u2019d be on your transcript forever, enough to knock you down in favour of one of your classmates. </p><p>Now, two jobs later, when it doesn\u2019t matter, he misses it, a little. Misery loves company, and he hadn\u2019t suffered alone. Myungsoo had helped, someone he\u2019d gone to high school with, someone who\u2019d he\u2019d taken all the same classes with\u2014but there\u2019d been a certain energy in a bunch of kids in their late teens, early twenties, that just didn\u2019t exist in the office. Hell, Sungyeol wasn\u2019t even sure if he still had that\u2014but the one time he\u2019d said that aloud to Myungsoo, Myungsoo had assured him he was just as childish as ever. </p><p>But it\u2019d been easier to laugh loudly, to complain loudly, to do everything with too much exuberance and eagerness, both the good and the bad. Chasing after deadlines just wasn\u2019t the same when it wasn\u2019t about you. Like chasing after a bus, only for the bus to get stuck in traffic. </p><p>With a sigh, Sungyeol finally gives up on the act, saving his work and locking up. He swings his bag over his shoulder and heads for the door. Not home, not yet, but he could do with a coffee. </p><p>The coffee shop is familiar. He doesn\u2019t stop at this one as often as he could, a bit out of the way from work, and during the day, it\u2019s busy and loud. </p><p>Now, at the end of the day, the place is quiet, and the only other table occupied were two highschoolers, bent over what looked like SAT prep books. Sungyeol absentmindedly orders his coffee, dumping in three packets of sugar before claiming a small table in the back corner. He leans back in the chair, coffee warm between his hands. The lighting here is soft, and the decorations match the whole wooden walls and quiet music. </p><p>\"You want to talk about it?\" Myungsoo had said. In line for coffee, frowning at Sungyeol. Someone had once described Myungsoo\u2019s eyes as dead, and Sungyeol could get where they were coming from, the look Myungsoo has when he\u2019s dazing off, his mind far elsewhere. But at that moment, Myungsoo\u2019s eyes were piercing through his skin, peeling away his thoughts. </p><p>\"Talk about what?\" Sungyeol had said. Myungsoo\u2019s eyes had narrowed at him, daring him to continue, to pretend that nothing was wrong. \"No. I don\u2019t,\" Sungyeol had said, instead. \"I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\" </p><p>\"Like you didn\u2019t want to talk over winter?\" Myungsoo had asked, and his eyes are sharp, and Sungyeol had looked away. </p><p>\"Shut up,\" he\u2019d said, and Myungsoo had dropped it, because they\u2019d gotten to the counter, and Myungsoo\u2019s always been more motivated by food than anything else\u2014but in this case, Sungyeol knows he\u2019s been given an out. It hadn\u2019t been why he\u2019d paid for both his large coffee and Myungsoo\u2019s iced cap, absolutely not. </p><p>Winter. </p><p>We need to talk, he'd said.</p><p>His phone rests on the table in front of him, next to his cooling coffee. His hand hovers over it briefly, before he scoops it up. He taps in a quick message and hits send before he can think too much of it. </p><p>The reply is almost instantaneous. </p><p><tt>nothing, at home, want to come over?</tt> </p><p><tt>no im busy</tt> </p><p><tt>get take out from next door</tt> </p><p>Sungyeol curses\u2014he couldn\u2019t at least ask why he was asking? just ordered him around instead?\u2014but he stuffs his phone into his pocket and nearly crushes his coffee with the other. Like he\u2019s actually going to\u2014 </p><p>Half an hour later, he\u2019s pushing open Woohyun\u2019s unlocked door, kicking his shoes off into the tangled pile. </p><p>Sunggyu doesn\u2019t seem to be home. </p><p>\"You better pay me back,\" Sungyeol calls out as he stalks into the apartment. </p><p>Woohyun emerges from the kitchen, carrying plates. </p><p>\"Mmm, broccoli chicken, right?\" he says, ignoring Sungyeol. </p><p>\"What if I hadn\u2019t shown up?\" Sungyeol says. He throws himself onto the couch. It sinks under his weight, a familiar sensation that almost feels like home. He grabs the remote and switches on the TV. </p><p>Woohyun shrugs and plucks the remote out of his hand, handing Sungyeol a pair of chopsticks in its place as he sits down next to him. The couch sinks under both their weights, and Sungyeol subtly shuffles away. </p><p>\"Cry in my room,\" Woohyun says. He flips past the news and a hockey game, before settling on some random documentary on Netflix.  </p><p>\"Where\u2019s Sunggyu?\" Sungyeol asks. It\u2019s about seals. He likes seals. </p><p>\"At his girlfriend\u2019s place, I think,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>He\u2019s still holding the remote. He leans forward to set it in its regular place, leans over Sungyeol. Sungyeol slaps him away, scowling, but the movement slides him closer to Sungyeol, and their knees touch. When Woohyun straightens, he doesn\u2019t move away. </p><p>\"For the night?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>Woohyun nods, apparently engrossed in the diet of the seals. </p><p>Sungyeol stands, the couch shifting under the loss of his weight. Woohyun glances up at him, the where are you going look. Sungyeol ignores him, weaving around the couch to the fridge like he\u2019s done a hundred times before. He yanks it open, grabs two beers, cracks them open, hands one to Woohyun, like he\u2019s done a hundred times before. </p><p>Maybe not quite a hundred, but the sentiment's the same. </p><p>\"I see you\u2019ve made yourself at home,\" Woohyun says quietly. </p><p>\"You\u2019re the one who told me don\u2019t be a stranger,\" Sungyeol says, words clipped. This time, he\u2019s the one to slide closer. </p><p>Woohyun stiffens, and takes a sip of his beer. </p><p>\"Yeah, but\u2026\" Woohyun trails off. </p><p>It\u2019s a far cry from the way Sungyeol had snapped at him for being insufferable and inexperienced all at the same time, and Woohyun finally losing his cool and telling Sungyeol that if he didn\u2019t like it, he could get out of the class. </p><p>Sungyeol wishes they still fought like that. Not that they were fighting, right now. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what they were, right now. </p><p>(Sungyeol\u2019s old enough now to recognize his own vindictive streaks, but never until long after it\u2019s happened.) </p><p>So he leans back, beer slowly warming in his hand, and learns about seals.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"I just asked what was up with your mood!\" Woohyun drags a hand across his face in exasperation. His expression is tired, and the lines around his mouth are taut.  </p><p>\"And I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, alright?\" Sungyeol snarls. He stalks into the kitchen, and then back, and Woohyun\u2019s still standing there in his living room, giving him the same confused, concerned, everything Sungyeol doesn\u2019t want right now look. \"And nothing! Nothing\u2019s up! And you\u2019re the last person I\u2019d talk to!\" </p><p>\"That's why you\u2019re throwing a temper tantrum, right? Like the baby you are?\" Woohyun\u2019s eyes flash at him, and Sungyeol knows he\u2019s finally pushed him past his limits, that he\u2019s finally pushed his limits one too many times. He\u2019s not\u2014he\u2019s not the last person he\u2019d talk to. Woohyun's arms are crossed over his chest, and his fingers have curled into fists. </p><p>\"Yeah? And your smug ass would know all about that\u2014you\u2026you\u2026\" </p><p>\"Run out of words? Can\u2019t figure out how to insult me?\" Woohyun taunts. </p><p>\"Is this your idea of comforting me?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Oh, I didn\u2019t know you wanted to be comforted.\" Woohyun\u2019s voice is contemptuous, and Sungyeol takes comfort in that. </p><p>\"Good, because I\u2019d be worried if you weren\u2019t trying to be a complete and total <i>dick</i>.\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Just leave it,\" Sungyeol says. His nails dig into his palms, and he turns, anything to avoid Woohyun\u2019s pitying eyes. </p><p>\"Look, Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"I said to leave it!\" </p><p>Woohyun reels back, hand falling from Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, hand flying to his face. Sungyeol drops his hand, bones throbbing where his fist had slammed into Woohyun. His eyes widen, and then they fall into that sad, puppy dog look, his mouth slightly parted, his brows slightly creased. </p><p>\"Get out,\" Sungyeol says. He swallows, his gut tight, everything falling away. Heat prickles at his eyes. His voice sounds dead to his own ears.  </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t move, and his hand is still covering his face, and Sungyeol wishes he\u2019d move it, because he wants to see, wants to know.  </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Just go!\" Sungyeol grabs Woohyun by the wrist, drags him to the door. Woohyun stumbles, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t care, just needs him gone. </p><p>It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s slammed the door behind Woohyun, as he wraps his arms around himself, pressing himself against the door, that he sees the umbrella still leaning against the wall. </p><p>The rain beats a staccato on the roof; each note brings his attention back to the lingering drops on the black fabric.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Oi, you get back here, Lee Sungjong!\" </p><p>\"Like heck I am!\" Sungjong yells over his shoulder, bolting down the sidewalk. He startles a flock of pigeons, taking to the air in a flurry of wings. </p><p>Sungyeol shoves past a laughing Sunggyu as he races after Sungjong. Sungjong doesn\u2019t have that much of a lead, and Sungyeol has longer legs. </p><p>\"Go easy on him!\" Woohyun calls out. \"I don\u2019t want to be the one to call his mom and tell her we got her son killed!\" </p><p>\"You shut up,\" Sungyeol says, flipping him off over his shoulder. Sungjong chooses that moment to look back, and Sungyeol chooses that moment to snag Sungjong\u2019s wrist. </p><p>\"Ahh, let go hyung,\" Sungjong whines, squirming away. </p><p>\"No way,\" Sungyeol says. He wraps an arm around Sungjong\u2019s neck. \"What do you say now?\" </p><p>Sungjong twists, smacking at Sungyeol\u2019s arm. \"I said I wanted pho, and I still do! You got to pick last time!\" </p><p>\"We could always go to that Thai place,\" Dongwoo suggests. He\u2019s laughing too, and Sungyeol does feel briefly ridiculous for chasing Sungjong down a public street\u2014but only until Sungjong takes the opportunity of Sungyeol glaring at Dongwoo to duck and flee. </p><p>Sungyeol crosses his arm and waits for the others to catch up. Sungjong sticks out his tongue at him, and Sungyeol makes a face back. </p><p>\"Won\u2019t it be busy?\" Myungsoo worries. </p><p>\"It\u2019s Friday night, everywhere\u2019s going to be busy,\" Sunggyu points out. He stops at the intersection. \"Alright, choose or I\u2019m choosing for you.\" </p><p>\"Fine, Thai,\" Sungyeol says quickly. \"I like that.\" </p><p>\"But\u2014\" Sungjong cuts himself off. </p><p>\"Then it\u2019s decided! Lead the way.\" </p><p>It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve all gotten together like this, seven people who got thrown together in university, ended up in the same city, and hung out too much together for their own good. Same programs, same dorms, mutual friends. Myungsoo inviting Woohyun to study with them, because Sungyeol knows him, however tangentially, and he must be smart, to have taught his class. (Woohyun had gotten roped in last minute, a last choice only available choice decision, but Sungyeol grudgingly has to admit he\u2019d done a good job.) Woohyun and Sunggyu weirdly close, Dongwoo in the same class, Howon his friend from the breakdancing club. Sungyeol\u2019s never sure how Sungjong happened\u2014Myungsoo, he thinks, or maybe Howon. (It was him, but Sungyeol tends to leave out the details.) The kid\u2019s in consulting, and gone half the time. They don\u2019t make sense, but relationships rarely make sense, a mix of fate and coincidences. </p><p>The restaurant is crowded when they get there, and Sungyeol is suddenly uncomfortably aware of Woohyun brushing against him\u2014they\u2019re all shoved together, waiting to be seated, jostling for space. It\u2019s too hot for this, and Sungyeol pushes away. Woohyun doesn\u2019t notice. </p><p>\"So what\u2019ve you been up to?\" Woohyun asks Myungsoo. They\u2019re settled at a long table towards the back. A breeze comes in from the open door to the outdoor seating area, and Sungyeol kind of wishes they could be there instead, since it\u2019s a nice late spring night.  </p><p>\"Work,\" Myungsoo says vaguely. He plays with his straw, and shrugs towards Sungyeol. Same stuff, he means. </p><p>\"He never tells me anything,\" Woohyun says, giving Sungyeol a snide look. </p><p>\"Why would I tell you anything?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Because you love me?\" Woohyun makes a heart with his hands. Sungyeol gags. </p><p>His chest feels like it\u2019s abut to explode. </p><p>He tunes Woohyun out for the rest of the night, opting instead to pick mercilessly on Sungjong. It\u2019s safer, and after an hour of what Myungsoo calls his insane cackle (he doesn\u2019t cackle), he\u2019s too high on elation to care. </p><p>They end up tumbling into Sunggyu and Woohyun\u2019s apartment, two blocks away, their doormat soon a mess of shoes. They\u2019d gone for drinks after, and there\u2019s a low buzz of energy flush against everyone\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"I hate horror movies,\" Sungjong moans. They arrange themselves on the couch and floor, Sunggyu hooking his laptop up to the TV. </p><p>\"No you don\u2019t,\" Myungsoo says at the same time Sungyeol says, \"you didn\u2019t have to come.\" </p><p>\"And miss out on seeing you scream like a baby?\" Sungjong says. \"No thanks.\" </p><p>Sungyeol tosses the remote at Sungjong\u2019s head\u2014his knee slams into the table instead. </p><p>\"Serves you right,\" Howon laughs, Sungyeol cursing his fate and Sungjong loudly in the same breath. </p><p>\"Ok, time to shut up,\" Sunggyu says. Someone squeezes in next to Sungyeol at the same time Sunggyu switches off the lights. </p><p>It\u2019s Woohyun, and he glances at Sungyeol as if daring him to say anything. Sungyeol jabs his elbow into his side. </p><p>The familiarity is almost disorienting, and for a moment, it feels like Sungyeol\u2019s nineteen again, and they\u2019re piled onto the ugly green couches in the dorm common room. Woohyun\u2019d been wedged between Sungyeol and the wooden arm. Their shoulders had touched, but by the end of the night, Woohyun was nearly on Sungyeol\u2019s lap, Sungyeol clutching at his shoulder and hiding behind his back. (He\u2019s not that scared, not like Myungsoo is hugging a pillow to his chest, but it\u2019s fun, and Sungyeol\u2019s always liked fun.) It\u2019s too easy to fall into the same patterns, because patterns are familiar, and patterns are easy. It\u2019s too easy to not think, not worry, to not hold the years of history between them that haven\u2019t always existed, to erase the months of skin hot against each other, and eyes that can\u2019t quite meet. It\u2019s too easy to ignore the voice that says don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, too easy to give into the one that tells him to be as selfish as he wants. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up with his head against Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, and Woohyun\u2019s hand resting lightly against his knee. He pulls away with a start. Woohyun draws away, his eyes never meeting his. Sungjong\u2019s clearly still awake, half hidden behind a pillow in front of them, but Myungsoo\u2019s dozed off leaning against the couch, and Dongwoo has too, even though it\u2019s barely midnight. It\u2019ll be hell to get them up again, Sungyeol thinks, but he knows Myungsoo\u2019s been pulling late nights to match their Asia offices. Maybe they were getting old. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up to Woohyun gently shaking his shoulder. </p><p>\"Everyone\u2019s staying the night,\" he says. \"Since no one has work tomorrow.\" </p><p>Sungyeol yawns, rubbing his eyes as he scans the room. </p><p>\"You're going to have to sleep in my room again, unless you want the kitchen.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019ll pass,\" Sungyeol says. He clambers over the back of the couch, and drags himself to Woohyun\u2019s room. Myungsoo\u2019s half on the couch even before Woohyun\u2019s pulled it out, and Howon\u2019s helping Sunggyu get spare blankets and sheets from his room.  </p><p>The sleeping bag\u2019s already laid out. Sungyeol eyes it, then pulls loose clothes out from Woohyun\u2019s drawers. </p><p>\"Not planning on sleeping naked?\" Woohyun asks as he walks in. </p><p>\"It\u2019s cold,\" Sungyeol says simply. </p><p>\"Suit yourself.\" </p><p>He reaches under the bedside table to monopolize Woohyun\u2019s charger like he always does, but his phone\u2019s in his bag, somewhere on the floor in the living room. </p><p>The blinds are open, and across the street, Sungyeol can see the shadows cast through lamp lit curtains. Motions of life flicker in and out of view, brief glimpses into anonymous lives. The buildings glow with the sheen of light that always clouds the city, billboards and office buildings and streetlights down below. Even up here, red flashes in the room, signatures of cars still awake and making their way through the streets. </p><p>The sleep haze slowly dissipates, and Sungyeol debates leaving, debates making his way to his own empty apartment. It\u2019s a long walk, but he doesn\u2019t mind walking. Nor is it cold. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>Woohyun comes in, pauses, hovering over Sungyeol hidden in the sleeping bag. </p><p>\"Already asleep?\" he asks. Sungyeol doesn\u2019t respond, doesn\u2019t move, and Woohyun steps carefully over him, and onto his bed. </p><p>Outside, there\u2019s the faint stirrings of someone shifting on the couch, the soft creaks of old furniture. Sungyeol traces the muted lines of his body with his eyes. The blanket is bunched in front of him, his shirt lifted just enough to expose a sliver of skin. Woohyun is nearly pressed up against the wall, and faint streaks of light cast across him through the still open blinds, breaking onto the empty side of the bed. </p><p>Outside, the lights in the apartment opposite turn off, but the lights of the city remain on. He\u2019s only ever seen them dark once\u2014a blackout, mid summer, and the first time he remembers seeing so many stars. </p><p>Woohyun is unmoving, and Sungyeol curls up a little tighter into himself. </p><p>A moment, a minute, an hour. </p><p>The mattress sinks under his knee as he climbs onto the bed. It\u2019s not cold, but Sungyeol tugs the blanket from Woohyun\u2019s grasp, and pulls it over the both of them. Woohyun stirs, but doesn\u2019t turn. </p><p>And Sungyeol sleeps, a transposition of Woohyun, a careful handspan apart.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The sleeping bag lies forgotten on the floor. Sungyeol leans over Woohyun on his bed, the dark light of a city night filtering in through the blinds. Woohyun\u2019s eyes are cautious, wary as he reaches up at Sungyeol, so Sungyeol grabs his fingers, brings them to his face and catches them in his mouth\u2014Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches, his eyes opening wide, mouth parting ever so slightly. It\u2019s enough\u2014Woohyun pulls Sungyeol down, only Sungyeol is already leaning down, kissing him. Woohyun\u2019s mouth is so hot and this is nothing like Sungyeol remembers, but it\u2019s been years and they\u2019re older and of course it\u2019s not. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s hands roam his body, and Sungyeol whines at the touch, whines for more, and Woohyun obliges. He\u2019s hot all over, Woohyun\u2019s tongue trapping his, and god, it feels so good the way he\u2019s using his mouth, the gentle pressure sending shockwaves right down to his crotch. Sungyeol lowers himself so he\u2019s lying on Woohyun, not propped on his elbows, and Woohyun immediately brings his arms around Sungyeol\u2019s body, and he\u2019s so warm and solid and Sungyeol grinds his thigh down between Woohyun\u2019s legs\u2014Woohyun whines in surprise, and Sungyeol does it again, and again, Woohyun\u2019s mouth still hot against his, until Woohyun\u2019s fingers clamp suddenly about him, and he muffles his cries against Sungyeol because Sunggyu is sleeping next door, and what Sungyeol would give to hear Woohyun moaning like that. </p><p>The thing is, Sungyeol doesn\u2019t like his roommates, and he\u2019s pretty sure they don\u2019t like him. It\u2019s far too easy to make excuses to stay overnight with Woohyun, and they\u2019re not even excuses, just reasons\u2014like every time Roommate #2  has his girlfriend over, or worse, when both #1 and #2 have their girlfriends over and they don\u2019t like each other very much and. </p><p>\"You need new roommates,\" Sunggyu tells him. </p><p>\"I need <i>no</i> roommates,\" Sungyeol grumbles, but this is convenient, ten minute walk to work\u2014five minutes to where Woohyun and Sunggyu live. </p><p>Pressed up against the far wall, Sungyeol with his back next to the window, and it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019re some ten floors up because it\u2019d be so easy to glance in and see Woohyun sucking greedy kisses against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, and Sungyeol has to bite on his own hand to keep quiet, because Woohyun\u2019s wrapped his hand around Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can last. But Woohyun lets go, palms Sungyeol\u2019s stomach. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t <i>stop</i>,\" Sungyeol says, but Woohyun places a finger against his lips. Wait, he means, and Sungyeol bites his tongue, because Woohyun\u2019s trailing kisses lower, and lower, and he\u2019s shuffled back until he\u2019s nearly on his stomach, and Sungyeol feels his own stomach drop. Not in a bad way, no, in a he\u2019s not sure if this is real and if this is too fast and then Woohyun\u2019s presses a kiss against Sungyeol\u2019s hip and: \"I won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want,\" Woohyun says, and his voice is soft and his eyes are uncertain and Sungyeol wonders why now, when he\u2019s usually a greater than life cloud of confidence\u2014Sungyeol pushes Woohyun\u2019s head down, and hopes that he\u2019ll take that as yes. Yes, he wants it. </p><p>\"I hope you\u2019re not moving in permanently,\" Sunggyu says. \"But you can stay if you do the laundry and the dishes.\" </p><p>\"What am I, Cinderella?\" Sungyeol snipes, and Woohyun has to stop him from killing Sunggyu when Sunggyu explains yes, and exactly why. </p><p>Third time\u2019s the charm, or something, and it\u2019s when Woohyun finally says, as they lie there in the morning sun: \"so\u2026is this a thing?\" </p><p>\"Do you want it to be a thing?\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"I\u2019m so tired I could die,\" Sungyeol whines. He throws himself onto the counter\u2014a passerby outside definitely gives him a strange look. Sungyeol wrinkles his nose at him.  </p><p>\"Hang in there,\" Myungsoo says. \"If you don\u2019t, then who\u2019s going to cause my early death from too much coffee consumption? That would be terrible, and you wouldn\u2019t want that to happen.\" </p><p>\"I liked it better when you didn\u2019t talk,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"When was that again? I don\u2019t remember that.\" Myungsoo laughs, leaning back on his stool. </p><p>The coffee shop is busy\u2014or rather, there\u2019s a herd of university kids, two tables pushed together, massive binders spread in front of them. They\u2019re loud enough that the music is a low buzz, and Sungyeol kind of wants to tell them to keep it down, but it\u2019s not so loud that it bothers them. Above it all, there\u2019s the voice of that talkative, cheerful barista with the cute smile. There\u2019s about two weeks before the big exam, and not even Sungyeol is that mean. Sungyeol had thought about it, briefly, but he\u2019s not that ambitious, not anymore\u2014he\u2019d taken the first round, passing by the edge of his teeth, but had never gotten around to doing the second. </p><p>\"Oh, someone on my team\u2019s taking level one too,\" Myungsoo says, when he notices that Sungyeol\u2019s attention has drifted. </p><p>\"Oh?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Yeah\u2014um, Joonmyun hyung, do you know him?\" </p><p>\"Joonmyun, Joonmyun\u2014hey, isn\u2019t he the computer guy?\" Sungyeol frowns. \"What\u2019s he doing that for?\" </p><p>Myungsoo shrugs. \"Why can\u2019t he?\" he says, then his eyes take on that amused glint. \"Maybe he\u2019s tired of dealing with all of us non engineers demanding silly things like explosions coming out of the buttons.\" </p><p>\"That was a joke!\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Well, his job still fills the work experience requirements,\" Myungsoo says. \"He probably knows as much about interest rates as much as the rest of us.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>Myungsoo suddenly sits up, and peers out the window. \"Isn\u2019t that Woohyun hyung?\" </p><p>Sungyeol whips about sharply, and sure enough, that\u2019s Woohyun walking down the street towards them. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll go see if\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, don\u2019t!\" Sungyeol pulls Myungsoo down, and it just happens that they\u2019re both facing the inside of the store, and not the store window. His heart doesn\u2019t seem to want to stop racing, and he swallows.  </p><p>\"Why?\" Myungsoo asks, his brows creased into a frown, but he doesn\u2019t get up or turn until a good half minute has passed, and they\u2019re both sure that Woohyun\u2019s walked past. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t want to deal with his obnoxious attitude right now,\" Sungyeol says. His coffee\u2019s almost gone, and he looks mournfully at the bottom of the cup. Maybe he\u2019ll get a refill. That\u2019d make it six for the day\u2014pushing it even for him. </p><p>\"What\u2019s been up between you two lately, anyway?\" Myungsoo says. </p><p>\"Nothing?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Hmmm,\" Myungsoo hums. He traces patterns onto the glass in front of them, and if it\u2019d been winter instead of early summer, Sungyeol wonders what he\u2019d be drawing. As it is, it\u2019s nonsensical and invisible and Myungsoo\u2019s mind seems to be absolutely elsewhere. </p><p>Sungyeol sighs and pushes his chair back. He could really do with another cup. The guy at the register has almost the same dazed off expression as Myungsoo, and Sungyeol snorts, hastily disguising it as a cough. Almost immediately, the smile\u2019s back, dimple and all, and Sungyeol really wonders how he does it. Sungyeol definitely couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\"Oi, still here?\" Sungyeol prods Myungsoo as he sits back down, hot coffee joining his empty cup. </p><p>\"You make good friends,\" Myungsoo says abruptly. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s eyebrows shoot up.  </p><p>\"<i>What</i>?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m just saying you make good friends,\" Myungsoo says, and Sungyeol suddenly realises he\u2019s talking about Woohyun, and his chest clenches. It\u2019d been Myungsoo that time, too, pointing out Woohyun across the street, a year after they\u2019d graduated. He\u2019d been surrounded by people, but Woohyun had caught his eye, and it\u2019s a story that\u2019s been unpaused. They hadn\u2019t been that close in university, anyway, and then Woohyun had graduated, moved on with his adult job and his adult life, while Sungyeol was still buried in exams. Myungsoo\u2019s gone back to staring out the window. \"Even if you weren\u2019t always friends.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s an understatement,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Alright, even if you used to hate his guts,\" Myungsoo says, and he\u2019s laughing without laughing, eyes crinkled, mouth stretched in a barely contained smile. </p><p>\"I did <i>not</i>!\" </p><p>\"Oh? If only I\u2019d recorded it somewhere,\" Myungsoo says, slowly reaching for his phone. \"Hm, can you send videos in text messages? I bet hyung would love to\u2014\" </p><p>\"Myungsoo, you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\" Sungyeol lunges for his phone, and his coffee wavers dangerously. </p><p>\"By the way,\" Myungsoo says, as they\u2019re on the way out, and he nods towards the kids still bent over their books. \"Are you ever going to take Level Two?\" </p><p>\"Nah, I\u2019m good,\" Sungyeol says. \"Besides\u2014never mind.\" </p><p>Besides, he\u2019s always been a little afraid of failure. (It\u2019s just never stopped him from trying.)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol is jittery with coffee, fifth cup of the day. It\u2019s seven in the evening, and he knows he won\u2019t be sleeping early tonight. It\u2019s a wet autumn, and rain falls against the window as he sits at the counter. People pass by, umbrellas and jackets, steps hurried, no wish to linger. A group of kids crowd into the poutine store across the street, and there\u2019s no one sitting outside the Starbucks next to it, and he doesn\u2019t blame them. </p><p>Someone slides into the seat beside him, and slides his hand over his. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll be back,\" Woohyun says. He sheds his wet coat and hangs it over the back of the chair. There\u2019s a lull, or maybe it\u2019s just the end of the day, and there\u2019s no one in line when Woohyun steps up to the counter. He says something that makes the girl there laugh, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers are still tapping restlessly against the table. </p><p>\"Did you want dinner after this? Chicken?\" Woohyun asks. He pushes back the chair, resting his apple cider onto the counter. </p><p>\"Maybe,\" Sungyeol says. He chews at the rim of the cup, as Woohyun takes the lid off his, stirring his cider with the cinnamon stick. </p><p>\"How many?\" Woohyun asks. He means the coffee. </p><p>\"Five,\" Sungyeol admits. It\u2019s bad for you, Woohyun is going to say, but he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>\"We could see a movie,\" Woohyun says. \"Or go to the mall.\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s fine.\" </p><p>\"Where\u2019s Myungsoo?\" he asks. </p><p>\"I dunno, probably at home.\" </p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then\u2014 </p><p>\"You\u2019re not mad at me?\" </p><p>Woohyun glances sharply at him, before his eyes flicker back to the street outside. \"Why would I be?\" he says. </p><p>\"Because I\u2014\" Sungyeol shakes his head. \"Never mind.\" </p><p>\"I would like it if you talked to me,\" Woohyun says wryly, and Sungyeol knows that Woohyun knows what he means. It\u2019s been weeks, and they\u2019ve seen each other since then, but Sungyeol\u2019s never had the nerve to ask. </p><p>\"I <i>do</i> talk to you,\" Sungyeol says petulantly. \"I\u2019m talking to you right now.\" </p><p>\"Yeah, I got that far,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>He\u2019s wearing a neat button down shirt, the sleeves a little damp where they rest on the table. Sungyeol is too, because it\u2019s the middle of the week, and anyway, unlike Woohyun, there is no casual Friday at work. </p><p>\"Do you want to come over?\" Woohyun says, and yes, that\u2019s exactly what Sungyeol wants. Sungyeol\u2019s place is closest, but that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s get drinks,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Okay,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol wishes he\u2019d ask again, wishes that he\u2019d say no, let\u2019s not go get drinks, let\u2019s not go to a movie, let\u2019s not get dinner. </p><p>But Woohyun doesn\u2019t, because unlike Sungyeol, Woohyun may be smug and insufferable, but he isn\u2019t a dick. </p><p>And Woohyun, like Myungsoo, doesn\u2019t push him unless necessary, but Myungsoo has never pulled him rain-drenched through the doorway of a dark apartment, and kissed him, water dripping down their hair, skirting their parted lips.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The weather swings between the lingering remains of summer, and the wet cold of the imminent winter. It\u2019s late, the end of the week, he\u2019s tired, and he wants to go home. Today\u2019s one of those cold days, and it\u2019s an easy choice to turn his steps towards the subway station, instead of the meandering forty something minutes walk home. It\u2019s fall, and the sun sets too early. His desk was lit by pale fluorescence, and the orange glow of the ending day is something he hasn\u2019t seen in a while. </p><p>The trees were already bare, skeletons awaiting the bitter wash of ice. Leaves have long been swept away from the gutters, and the lengthened nights already seem to be taking their toll on the city, people hurting down streets, hands in pockets, faces hidden in scarves. </p><p>Sungyeol walks, hunched into himself, the wind at his back. He pauses to stuff a twenty into a cup, the woman huddled into the recess between two buildings calling out a thank you he\u2019s too tired to acknowledge. The subway\u2019s far from empty, but it\u2019s also far from full, and Sungyeol stares blankly at an ad he\u2019s seen hundreds of times before, hand wrapped around a pole, nearly missing his stop. </p><p>He\u2019s just missed the bus, and the next one doesn\u2019t come for fifteen minutes, the same amount of time it takes to walk. </p><p>\"Hey.\" </p><p>It\u2019s Woohyun\u2019s voice, and for a moment, Sungyeol contemplates ignoring it. </p><p>\"What are you doing down here?\" Sungyeol asks. He turns, and sure enough, it\u2019s Woohyun, walking down towards the subway. </p><p>Woohyun shrugs, gesturing vaguely. \"Have you eaten yet?\" he asks. He nods towards the main street, where he\u2019s just come from, and where late night places are still open. </p><p>\"You know I haven\u2019t.\" Sungyeol\u2019s brows rise. </p><p>\"Me neither,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s lying. \"Let\u2019s grab dinner.\" </p><p>\"Only if you\u2019re paying,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Sure,\" Woohyun says. It almost catches Sungyeol by surprise. </p><p>It\u2019s not the first time Woohyun\u2019s agreed to Sungyeol\u2019s demands, but it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s agreed so readily. </p><p>It\u2019s become too easy to see each other, to say 'let\u2019s grab dinner, and usually it\u2019s Woohyun who says 'want to come over?' because they usually meet in his neck of the woods. It\u2019s easier than unexpected detours on his way home, to walking faster when he catches sight of a familiar shadow. Sometimes he stays the night, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t. Sometimes it feels like everything\u2019s gone back to normal. He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s a normal he remembers very well.  </p><p>Their conversation is muted and spare, over fried chicken and beer. The girls at the table behind Woohyun eagerly fill their silence. Friday means a busier crowd, even though it\u2019s already past nine. The karaoke place across the street\u2019s open for another six hours, and it\u2019ll probably be full for most of them. Sungyeol asks about his work, and Woohyun answers in words Sungyeol knows, but in sentences that completely elude his grasp. His eyes keep swinging to the TV in the back corner, where an old music show is playing </p><p>\"You know the saying, when it rains, it pours?\" Woohyun says suddenly. </p><p>Sungyeol wrenches back his attention. There\u2019s a faint crease between Woohyun\u2019s brows, and no hint of a smile, forced or real, in the lines of his face. </p><p>\"It hasn\u2019t rained lately,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun wraps his hands around his beer. \"But when it does,\" he says. \"Never mind. You normally don\u2019t work this late.\" </p><p>\"How would you know?\" Sungyeol says, but Woohyun raises an eyebrow\u2014of course he knows\u2014and Sungyeol shrugs instead. </p><p>\"Crunch time,\" he says. \"End of quarter reports are due.\" </p><p>\"Seems like they\u2019re always due.\" </p><p>\"They\u2019re more due than usual.\" </p><p>\"Hmm.\" </p><p>Woohyun reaches for the bill, as promised, but Sungyeol pulls it away, replacing Woohyun's bills with his own, before pushing it to the ahjumma at the cashier. </p><p>\"I thought,\" Woohyun begins to say, but leaves that thought unfinished as Sungyeol thanks her for their change, sliding it all back anyway. </p><p>\"Come over,\" Sungyeol says suddenly. </p><p>Woohyun freezes, then frowns. </p><p>\"I\u2019m always at your place,\" Sungyeol says.  </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s palms are suddenly too warm, and he shoves them into the pockets of his jacket as he shoulders his way out the door. Months have passed since Woohyun\u2019s last been over\u2014Sungyeol has nearly become a regular in his apartment instead. </p><p>\"It\u2019s late,\" he adds. For a moment, he hears it in Woohyun\u2019s voice. </p><p>What the fuck, his mind says, but Sungyeol has always been good at heeding advice. </p><p>\"Alright,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol doesn\u2019t know what answer he\u2019d been hoping for. He nods down the street, darker, emptier, the one that leads to where Sungyeol lives. \"Lead the way.\" </p><p>They slip into his apartment, quiet, some of his neighbours\u2019 windows already dark. Sungyeol kicks off his shoes into the corner, and drags a still hesitant Woohyun in through the door. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t be a stranger,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t think I ever was.\" </p><p>There\u2019s that old example\u2014a coffee mug is the same as a donut, a ball, the same as a ball. All it takes is a little push and pull, just enough force, a continuous deformation until it\u2019s gone from one state to the other, from the other back to the first, each belonging to the same equivalence class. But break a donut into two halves, and each is the same as a ball. Pinch two donuts into one, and infinity stretches into an impossible bottle, into the shapings of a heart. </p><p>Hands rough against skin, lips crashing into teeth, two bodies tumbling onto the couch, twisted, tangled. Sungyeol clutches at Woohyun\u2019s shirt, while Woohyun\u2019s hands play against the ridges of his spine. Familiar and unfamiliar, too long, too long, too long. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s mouth sucks teasing, hot and wet against his, and Sungyeol moans openly, pressing himself against Woohyun, Woohyun grinding up against him just as eagerly. He\u2019s dizzy, head spinning\u2014he pushes Woohyun against the wall, pulls away just long enough for Woohyun to look up, lips parted, shiny, swollen, before Sungyeol leans in, teeth closing around Woohyun\u2019s lower lip. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s fingers dig into the back of his neck; Sungyeol couldn\u2019t have pulled away even if he wanted to, but he doesn\u2019t, he wants Woohyun writhing under him like this, hips pushing upwards, only Sungyeol is half kneeling on his thigh and Woohyun\u2019s desperation clear in the way he has Sungyeol kiss him instead. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s cheeks are flushed, his chest rising and falling, eyes fixed on Sungyeol. </p><p>Such a bad idea\u2014it flits through his mind, but then Woohyun\u2019s tongue flickers at Sungyeol\u2019s fingers that\u2019d been tracing the line of Woohyun\u2019s jaw. </p><p>Sungyeol lets him, lets his tongue circle his finger, hot and wet, as he presses it against the corner of his mouth. Woohyun\u2019s eyes promise so much more. Hot, wet, and tight, and when Woohyun leans forward, catching him between his lips, pressing him between his tongue and the roof of his mouth. Sungyeol shifts until he\u2019s straddling Woohyun; his eyes have fallen shut, but he opens them, shoves in, deep, so he can watch Woohyun gag, the moment of surprise, but not for long, as Sungyeol imagines the hot heat of Woohyun\u2019s tongue swirling around his dick, of his swollen red lips, of Woohyun looking up at him like that, from between his legs. </p><p>With a wet pop, Sungyeol pulls away. </p><p>\"I\u2019m\u2026\" His voice is rough and hoarse. He swallows, wetting his throat. </p><p>Whatever words follow flee his mind as soon as they form. He wipes his hand against his pants, and turn away. </p><p>\"You can shower first,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Yeah, okay.\" The couch creaks as Woohyun stands. He pauses, briefly, a step behind and a step to the left, before he walks past Sungyeol and into the bathroom. </p><p>There\u2019s a spare towel in the drawer, and Woohyun knows where it is. </p><p>The couch sinks under Sungyeol\u2019s weight, as he drops himself onto it, again. The table\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s been a mess for well over a week. His skin\u2019s on fire and his clothes confining, but he doesn\u2019t trust himself to move, to touch, not right now. The sound of rushing water stops, and a few minutes later, Woohyun walks out, hair damp, towel tied around his waist. </p><p>\"Same place as usual,\" Sungyeol says. Spare set of clothes, he means. Woohyun knows, this isn\u2019t an unfamiliar tableau, just one that hasn\u2019t been visited in a while. </p><p>Sungyeol rubs his eyes, then takes his turn in the shower, the water running hot against his skin until it prickles from the scalding temperature, instead of his burning nerves. </p><p>\"Your bed,\" Woohyun says, as Sungyeol goes into his room. He\u2019s sitting at Sungyeol\u2019s desk, staring at it. </p><p>\"What about it?\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s so\u2026neat,\" he says. </p><p>Sungyeol snorts. \"Take it,\" he says. He tosses his clothes into the laundry bin, toweling his hair as he walks back out. </p><p>\"Hey, Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"I told you, it\u2019s crunch period,\" Sungyeol says. Papers are scattered across the table, and Sungyeol pulls his laptop out, powering it on. Woohyun had trailed out after him, his presence awkward in the space between Sungyeol\u2019s room, and Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I\u2019ve been sleeping out here anyway,\" Sungyeol says. It wasn\u2019t, at least, a lie. </p><p>His eyes are fixed on the screen, even as he keeps note of Woohyun, finally turning around. </p><p>\"Good night,\" Woohyun says softly. </p><p>\"Mmmm.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol wakes to the ache of an empty apartment, but when he pads across the room, his bed is still occupied. Softly, he returns to the kitchen, methodically pouring beans into the grinder, turning the handle until they\u2019re not too fine, just coarse enough for the coffee to steep well. The electric kettle\u2019s been filled and turned on, and Sungyeol grabs two mugs from the shelf. He stares at them for a moment, then returns one, replacing it with a mug on the shelf above, shoved all the way to the back. </p><p>Footsteps sound behind him, and Sungyeol pours the ground coffee into the bottom of the french press, fingers tapping against the counter as he waits for the water to boil. </p><p>\"There\u2019s cereal,\" Sungyeol says. \"That\u2019s it.\" </p><p>\"And coffee.\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s voice is still rough with sleep, and it skips across Sungyeol like a live wire. </p><p>\"I always have coffee,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun chuckles, taking a step closer, and then another, until he\u2019s leaning against the counter besides Sungyeol, arms over his chest. \"You ran out once,\" he says. </p><p>\"Ugh, don\u2019t bring it up.\" </p><p>\"It wasn\u2019t pleasant for me either!\" Woohyun\u2019s quick to point out. </p><p>Sungyeol scowls in irritation, although there\u2019s no one to see it but the kettle, as he slowly pours the water into the french press. \"You\u2019re still mad I sent you out for more?\" </p><p>\"Of course not,\" Woohyun laughs, eyes scrunched, grin wide. </p><p>Sungyeol turns back to the coffee. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not petty like you,\" Woohyun adds. </p><p>\"You\u2019re lucky I like my coffee more than I like you,\" Sungyeol growls. </p><p>\"Ouch,\" Woohyun says. He reaches across the counter, over Sungyeol. Sungyeol pulls back and turns towards the fridge, but Woohyun only grabs two bowls from the drying rack, and Sungyeol grabs the milk. Woohyun doesn\u2019t wait, just pours himself a bowl of Lucky Charms, and takes the milk from Sungyeol. </p><p>\"You really need to do groceries,\" Woohyun comments. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t feel like it,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs, checking the time on the stove. \"I never eat here anyway.\" </p><p>\"Not even breakfast?\" </p><p>\"Especially not breakfast.\" </p><p>\"Fair enough,\" Woohyun says. The spoons are in the drawer in front of Sungyeol, and Sungyeol takes a step back when Woohyun reaches for it. </p><p>The thing about patterns was that patterns were easy, and patterns were familiar. Patterns were automatic, patterns mean that they don\u2019t have to think. Patterns mean that they move around each other in ways they always have, or once had. Like gears that\u2019ve fallen out of use, stiff and skipping and scraping and ungreased, but still, they click against each other, turning, turning, turning. </p><p>\"Doing anything today?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>Sungyeol glances up from his coffee. \"Just work,\" he says. \"I\u2019m busy.\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s eyes are focussed on him in consideration. \"You need a break,\" he says. </p><p>\"You\u2019re not my mom,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Good, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve got that sorted out.\" </p><p>Sungyeol puts the mug down, tracing the handle with a finger, down the plain lines that encircle its wide rim. \"What\u2019d you have in mind?\" </p><p>\"You could do your groceries,\" Woohyun suggests. His eyes are laughing and Sungyeol kicks his ankle. </p><p>\"The mall? A movie? Take a walk in the park?\" </p><p>\"What park?\" Sungyeol asks, and then: \"are you paying?\" </p><p>\"For your groceries? Keep dreaming.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re the one who wants to see a movie,\" Sungyeol says, even though that hadn\u2019t been what Woohyun had said at all. </p><p>\"You\u2019re asking me to take you out on a date?\" Woohyun asks.  </p><p>\"I should do groceries,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s go shopping,\" Woohyun says. \"And get groceries on the way back.\" </p><p>\"<i>Let\u2019s</i>?\" Sungyeol says. \"I don\u2019t seem to recall saying I wanted your company.\" </p><p>\"You always want my company,\" Woohyun says flippantly. \"You know you miss it.\" </p><p>\"Gross.\" Sungyeol gags. </p><p>\"So is that a yes or no?\" </p><p>\"I guess I\u2019ll let you borrow my clothes,\" Sungyeol says, and he supposes that it's  answer enough.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The wind, when they venture outside several hours later, is bitter and cold, and Sungyeol regrets it almost immediately. Woohyun\u2019s huddled into his coat as well, hands in his pockets, wind whipping his hair into his face. It\u2019s a soft brown, and Sungyeol wonders when he\u2019d changed it. </p><p>\"It\u2019s cold, isn\u2019t it?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Obviously,\" Sungyeol snaps. </p><p>\"Maybe we should\u2019ve checked the weather,\" Woohyun says. There\u2019s a crease between his brows. </p><p>\"That would\u2019ve been too smart for you,\" Sungyeol says. He conveniently forgets that he hadn\u2019t either\u2014it hadn\u2019t been his idea to go outside, would be what he\u2019d say if Woohyun pointed it out. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t point it out. </p><p>The day was bright, the sun piercing, its warmth shattered by the wind. It\u2019s late October, but winter\u2019s started earlier than that before, and maybe this was going to be one of those years. It\u2019d been in the mid twenties last week, but the weather one day is no guarantee of the season the next. A softball game is underway down the hill in the park, a mix of kids and teens. An old man is walking his dog across the street, the pit mix trotting ahead of him, then turning back, matching his pace. Sensing danger, a fluffy white cat darts under a parked car, their tail visible, swishing back and forth in irritation. </p><p>By the time they hit the main street, Sungyeol\u2019s ears are cold, and Woohyun\u2019s cheeks are pink. </p><p>\"I know where we should go first,\" Woohyun says. He rubs his hands together, then grabs Sungyeol\u2019s wrist and tugs him across the side street. </p><p>\"I can cross the street by myself!\" Sungyeol yanks his hand back. \"There aren\u2019t even any cars!\" </p><p>\"Children should always hold an adult\u2019s hand when crossing streets,\" Woohyun says, laughing. He runs off before Sungyeol can hit him, dodging a large group of teenagers who give them dirty looks. Woohyun doesn't get very far, and Sungyeol hooks an arm about Woohyun\u2019s neck. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not even shorter than you!\" Sungyeol says.  </p><p>\"Height has nothing to do with age,\" Woohyun says, ruffling Sungyeol\u2019s hair. </p><p>Sungyeol rolls his eyes and lets go. He could be an adult, thanks very much. </p><p>They walk down the familiar street, past the place they\u2019d eaten last night. Despite the chill, it's still busy, groups of friends pushing past each other. A heavy mix of English and Korean and Chinese threads down the street, weaving in and out and skipping across and over, as people pass people, little clusters of private lives. Sungyeol buries his hands deeper into his pockets, wondering where Woohyun has in mind. Well, there\u2019s only a few places, really, stationary shops and the like. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s go in,\" Woohyun says\u2014before Sungyeol could protest, he\u2019d grabbed his wrist again, and was pulling him into a store, colourful bags arranged in the window. </p><p>An old Girl\u2019s Generation song is playing, and without the wind, the warmth inside is immediate. It\u2019s small, narrow, full of accessories. Sungyeol\u2019s stopped by before, helping Myungsoo pick something out for his at the time girlfriend. The owner greets them from the register, and Woohyun waves back cheerfully. There\u2019s an arrangement of ties next to the counter, but Woohyun has gone around the center aisle of bags, heading towards the back of the shop. </p><p>\"Why here?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Because it\u2019s cold!\" he says. Woohyun hums, running his hand in the air over a row of scarves. Ah, because it's cold. </p><p>\"This would look cute on you,\" Woohyun says. He drapes it around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, Sungyeol too stunned to stop him, then pushes Sungyeol in front of the mirror. \"See, I knew it.\" </p><p>Woohyun is peering at his reflection over Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, over the bright red scarf looped loosely over his shoulder. Sungyeol grudgingly admits the scarf looks nice, and tells himself it\u2019s not because Woohyun had picked it out. </p><p>\"It\u2019s a scarf,\" Sungyeol says flatly. </p><p>\"I know it\u2019s a scarf,\" Woohyun says. He doesn't wait for Sungyeol to reply, and before Sungyeol has a chance to protest, Woohyun's paid for it and was tugging Sungyeol out of the store again. </p><p>Sungyeol pulls away as soon as they step outside. </p><p>\"What is <i>wrong</i> with you?\" he says. \"You\u2019re acting all\u2026\" he trails off, not quite able to find the words he needs. Familiar. Like they\u2019re more than friends. But that\u2019s all they are. </p><p>\"You need a break,\" Woohyun says again. </p><p>\"Yeah, whatever, but what the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\" Sungyeol ignores the looks directed towards them. </p><p>\"Nothing,\" Woohyun says. \"I just wanted to\u2026look, we don\u2019t need to fight about everything, alright?\" </p><p>\"We\u2019re not <i>fighting</i>,\" Sungyeol says. He shakes his head and shoves his hands in his pockets, burying his face deeper into the scarf. \"Let\u2019s go get coffee.\" </p><p>They get coffee, and then they get snacks at the grocery store, the red bean fish cakes quickly cooling in the wind outside. Woohyun drags him to look at the newest girl group CDs, and Sungyeol decides that yeah, he wants to see a movie after all. They take the subway down, Woohyun picking the new superhero movie, paying for their tickets like Sungyeol had demanded. Sungyeol buys the popcorn, and the movie's not great, but it\u2019s not terrible either. The mall is packed, and there\u2019s not much point hanging around. They meander down the street anyway, just long enough for Woohyun\u2019s cheeks to flush pink again, and this time, Sungyeol shoves Woohyun into a store, and picks a random scarf out from a shelf. It's worth it, to see Woohyun\u2019s look of surprise. The sun is quickly falling below the horizon, and they end up riding the subway back up. Not chicken, though, opting instead for a different place they used to frequent. Either Woohyun suggests it, or Sungyeol does, but they end up pushing into the karaoke place, flush with two bottles of soju, Sungyeol singing girl group songs half tone deaf, Woohyun crooning ballads of lost love. Sungyeol drops onto the couch next to Woohyun, and Woohyun\u2019s hand brushes against his shoulder. </p><p>It's a flush that carries them down the street, and back to Sungyeol\u2019s apartment, and it's too late for Woohyun to leave, Sungyeol says. By the time Sungyeol's out of the shower, Woohyun's already in bed\u2014Sungyeol glances at the couch in the living room. He pushes Woohyun to the other side of the bed, and slides under the covers, instead. </p><p>Summer had passed and winter hadn\u2019t yet come, and the heat from their bodies mingle beneath the blanket, covering them both. Woohyun's lying on his back, and Sungyeol on his side, eyes tracing the shadow of Woohyun\u2019s profile. The light\u2019s off, but the city's never entirely dark, and it's through the not quite opaque blinds that Sungyeol sees the wealth of people\u2019s lives reflected in Woohyun\u2019s still open eyes. </p><p>They stare up, towards the ceiling, until, perhaps sensing Sungyeol\u2019s scrutiny, fall shut. Sungyeol too, lets his eyelids fall. </p><p>They are a handspan apart, and a hand brushes against his. Their fingers tangle briefly together, before he pulls away. The buzz from before hasn't quite left, and as they lie there, Sungyeol truly understand what it means to tremble with need. Mouth, hot against his skin; fingers ghosting down the line of his neck; hand clasped about his wrist, hand pressed against his shoulder, hand running down his thigh. </p><p>They\u2019re so close, and he knows that if he just reaches out, a finger\u2019s width, if he just reaches out and curls his fingers about his, then maybe\u2026Then maybe. </p><p>He wills his eyes shut again, rolls onto his back, tries to pretend that he\u2019s not lying in bed next to a man who he\u2019d very much like to kiss, a man who he\u2019d very much like to kiss him, to hold him down, to suck at his skin with lips and teeth all hot and wet and leave him with so little control of himself. Tries to pretend that they hadn\u2019t, twenty four hours ago, done nearly the same thing\u2014but he\u2019s the one who\u2019d pulled away, the one to step away, because they can\u2019t, because they shouldn\u2019t\u2014because he\u2019s greedy, and he wants more. </p><p>Their fingers touch again, and they are neither of them asleep. </p><p>Woohyun brushes his finger across the inside of Sungyeol\u2019s wrist, a shuddering breath running down the lines of his body. Carefully, he traces it upwards, circling the back of his thumb, letting his hand slide up Sungyeol\u2019s arm. Sungyeol doesn\u2019t move, as if frozen, the only indication a faint tremor as his breath sticks in his lungs. His hand pauses, just below Sungyeol\u2019s elbow, as if afraid to go any further, as if saying that they could stop, that all he had to do was roll over, to roll away, and none of this would\u2019ve happened. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t, and so he continues to feel the minute ridges of skin against skin, until it comes to rest on his shoulder, the same shoulder that a few hours earlier, he\u2019d just as barely dared to place his hand on. </p><p>He\u2019d still yet to move, so he traces his fingers against his neck, along his collar bones, settling in the hollow of his throat. His pulse beats loud, and he can\u2019t be sure how much of that is his own, running through his veins, pounding against every inch of his skin. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t dare move closer, yet he also can\u2019t bear to draw away, and so his touch lingers, five beats, six, ten, twenty. Twenty one, twenty two\u2014too long, but he\u2019s barely withdrawn when thin fingers wrap around his wrist, and Sungyeol\u2019s pulled him onto his side. </p><p>\"Are\u2026\" Woohyun begins to say, but it\u2019s swallowed as Sungyeol props himself up on one elbow. He leans in close, his breath skimming Woohyun\u2019s skin. Fingers trace his wrist, and then Sungyeol\u2019s rolled on top of him, his weight heavy, reassuring. His hand brushes against his face, Sungyeol holding himself up just enough for Woohyun to see the light glint off his eyes, and then he\u2019s too close, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t think, just clutches him against him, fingers tangling in his hair, kissing him, being kissed. Sungyeol\u2019s hand cups the side of his face, and Woohyun\u2019s hand slips beneath Sungyeol\u2019s tank, riding up his back, until it comes to rest between his shoulder bones. Sungyeol\u2019s leg is beneath Woohyun\u2019s and Woohyun\u2019s leg is between Sungyeol\u2019s, Sungyeol grinding against him, small sounds slipping into Woohyun\u2019s mouth. God, his mouth was so hot, and Woohyun lets Sungyeol do the work, lets Sungyeol take control, lets Sungyeol draw back just enough for Woohyun to see the want glowing in his eyes, then let Sungyeol catches his lip between his, because there\u2019s a need in Sungyeol that Woohyun\u2019s missed, that Woohyun\u2019s craved and had forgotten and it\u2019s almost like the first time.  </p><p>His hand traces the ridges of Sungyeol\u2019s spine, following the line of his body to the hollow of his  hip, and Sungyeol\u2019s breath hitches, even as he continues kissing Woohyun, Woohyun heady and breathless. </p><p>A small moan, and Woohyun takes that for encouragement, takes Sungyeol grinding against him as encouragement, and slips his hand beneath the elastic of his waistband, circling Sungyeol\u2019s cock. He\u2019s hard, so hard, he\u2019d felt it against him and it takes so little, Sungyeol biting down against him, loud, like in everything else he does. Woohyun catches these sounds in his mouth and rolls him over, still rubbing circles against the head of his cock, pressing him into the mattress, until Sungyeol comes, one long drawn out whine, and Woohyun, taking that sound deep into him, letting it pool at the base of his stomach, grinds against Sungyeol\u2019s leg, until he feels the tension explode and escape and suffuse his skin and his nerves and for long moments, all he feels is Sungyeol, Sungyeol, Sungyeol\u2014 </p><p>He pulls away, chest rising and falling, breathing hard. His head is spinning, his mind cloudy, his limbs not quite his own. There\u2019s a sense of familiarity buried deep inside him, mixed with the sense of something he can\u2019t quite touch. And then there\u2019s Sungyeol, a handspan apart, and out of the corner of his eye, he sees his face, flushed, hair plastered against the side, slick with sweat. His eyes are turned steadfastly upwards, and Woohyun, for a moment, thinks about running his hand through Sungyeol\u2019s hair. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though. </p><p>Hot, sweaty, sticky, he drifts off to sleep, and Sungyeol is beside him.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He wakes early, slips out from under the covers, careful not to wake the other. </p><p>The sun hasn't quite risen, because it\u2019s late in the season. He closes the door behind him, and then the door to the bathroom, as he rinses last night off his skin, sloughing away beneath the hot stream of water. </p><p>He towels himself dry, and his hair, and then he goes back into the room where Sungyeol is still asleep, picking up from the floor the clothes he\u2019d worn to work, where he\u2019d left it two nights ago. He dresses, and Sungyeol still does not wake, because the sun hasn\u2019t quite made its slow way into the world. </p><p>He could, Woohyun thinks, leave now. He could leave a note, or nothing at all and just slip away, and they could both go back to pretending that last night, and the night before, moments of indiscretion, could be wiped from both their memories as if they\u2019d never existed. He doesn\u2019t want to, but he could. </p><p>He doesn't. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s fridge isn\u2019t quite empty\u2014milk, a beer, a half empty jar of kimchi, two eggs in the door. </p><p>This might\u2019ve been Sungyeol\u2019s apartment, but Woohyun was no stranger. </p><p>Humming quietly to himself, he pulls bowls and chopsticks from the cabinets, the drawers, and raids what little is in Sungyeol\u2019s fridge. The motions are near automatic, something akin to memory. He\u2019ll make coffee later, when Sungyeol is awake. </p><p>\"What are you doing?\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart leaps, and when he turns, Sungyeol is leaning against the wall, eyes staring sleepily at him. He\u2019s always been handsome, and even now, half awake, Woohyun feels attraction stir inside of him. He forces his heart down, and forces a grin onto his face. </p><p>It\u2019s not that hard, because it\u2019s Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Making breakfast, obviously,\" he says. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s eyes flicker across the kitchen, and Woohyun turns back to the stove, testing the edge of the pancake. Bubbles are beginning to form on the batter, but if he flips it too soon, it\u2019ll break. </p><p>\"Who asked you to do that?\" And Sungyeol\u2019s voice is curt and short and he moves past Woohyun, his presence fleeting. He grabs the dishcloth as he does, to clean up the mess on the counter Woohyun had meant to clean. </p><p>\"Well look who\u2019s a ray of sunshine,\" Woohyun says. Maybe he should\u2019ve left. Maybe he should\u2019ve waited for Sungyeol to get up first. Maybe, last night, he shouldn\u2019t have wanted. </p><p>He\u2019s forgotten how volatile Sungyeol can be, at times. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll make coffee,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun swallows back the 'I was going to get to that,' he wants to say. </p><p>\"Alright,\" he says instead. </p><p>Sungyeol sets the kettle on, and Woohyun watches him out of the corner of his eyes. He hasn\u2019t changed, his arms thin and pale and bare, his hair a mess, and he knows this is a picture that few other\u2019s have seen. That only Woohyun\u2019s seen. He swallows the thought down, and turns back to the stove. </p><p>\"And why pancakes? We could\u2019ve just had cereal again, I don\u2019t\u2014\" </p><p>\"<i>You</i> can have cereal again if you don\u2019t want it,\" Woohyun cuts him off. This is the last one, and he turns the heat off the stove, checking underneath to make sure it\u2019s done. </p><p>\"God, this makes it feel like we\u2019re boyfriends or something,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart had leapt, and now it plummets, but he\u2019ll be damned if he lets it show. He\u2019s never sure if Sungyeol does it on purpose, or if he does it without thinking, or if he can\u2019t tell the difference himself. </p><p>The smell of coffee replaces conversation. Woohyun stares at some point behind Sungyeol\u2019s head, while Sungyeol stares down at his own plate, or maybe Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>They weren\u2019t, of course. Boyfriends. I get it, Woohyun had told him. We\u2019re just friends.  </p><p>But last night, for a brief moment, he\u2019d thought they could be, again. </p><p>Sungyeol doesn\u2019t think that. </p><p>Sungyeol kicks him under the table, and Woohyun looks up to see Sungyeol\u2019s scowl. </p><p>\"What was that for?\" </p><p>\"For being annoying,\" Sungyeol grumbles. </p><p>\"Wow, look who\u2019s talking.\" Woohyun scoffs and rolls his eyes, and lets the usual bickering carry them through. He kicks Sungyeol back, but changes his mind\u2014he slides his foot up Sungyeol\u2019s shin, watches him, warily, watches his expression flicker to surprise, before schooling back into neutrality. Sungyeol jerks away, and his face disappears behind his mug. </p><p>\"I\u2019d better get going.\" His chair scrapes back loudly as he stands. It grates, and he really should\u2019ve just left before Sungyeol had awoken. Maybe that\u2019s what Sungyeol had meant, what are you doing, he hadn\u2019t meant the pancakes. He grins at Sungyeol, tapping at his empty plate. \"I cooked, so you get the dishes.\" </p><p>Sungyeol wrinkles his nose in discontent. </p><p>\"I knew I\u2019d be cleaning up your mess,\" he grumbles. </p><p>Woohyun chuckles, and turns to go. \"Don\u2019t miss me too much,\" he says. </p><p>He knows Sungyeol\u2019s gotten up behind him, and for a moment, he thinks about turning, about grabbing Sungyeol by the wrist, about holding him against the wall and kissing him until neither of them can breath. He thinks about sucking bright red marks into his skin, even though Sungyeol is usually the possessive one, and Woohyun\u2019s always been glad for the power of BB cream. </p><p>But he doesn\u2019t. </p><p>He grabs his bag, his coat\u2014the scarf, a dark blue\u2014from the floor, and bends down to tie his shoes, Sungyeol trailing behind him like an overgrown dog. </p><p>He should\u2019ve gone before Sungyeol had awoken. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, when Woohyun straightens. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. He reaches for the door handle, slowly, unsure if this was really okay, unsure if maybe they should talk about it\u2014he hopes they don\u2019t, he hopes they won\u2019t\u2014or if they\u2019re really going to pretend nothing\u2019s happened. </p><p>(He hopes they won\u2019t do that, either.) </p><p>He opens the door. </p><p>Sungyeol reaches past him, and closes it. </p><p>\"What\u2014\" but Woohyun doesn\u2019t get to finish that, not when Sungyeol\u2019s grabbed his shirt. Woohyun\u2019s things fall to the floor. </p><p>Sungyeol is suddenly so close, and last night still lingers on his skin, and then Sungyeol\u2019s lips are against his and Woohyun\u2019s thoughts disappear into the rush of blood. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s tongue slips between Woohyun\u2019s parted lips, his hand cupped behind Woohyun\u2019s neck. He\u2019s hot against him, and Woohyun slides his hands around Sungyeol\u2019s back, his pants suddenly too tight. Sungyeol moans into his mouth and Woohyun worries briefly about the neighbours, but that thought too is soon lost in the heat of Sungyeol sucking at his lip. </p><p>His head is dizzy with need\u2014Woohyun pulls back, pushes Sungyeol away, and this time, he pushes Sungyeol against the door, and this time, he kisses Sungyeol hungrily. Sungyeol whines, grinding against him, his need fueling Woohyun\u2019s own. He pushes his tongue past Sungyeol\u2019s lips, Sungyeol briefly pressing them shut before he lets him in. He holds Sungyeol down, presses a hand against his bare chest, even when Sungyeol tries to pull away\u2014he feels his mind\u2019s eye slowly going black with a need for air, and he knows Sungyeol, less prepared, is too. </p><p>He kisses him, again, until Sungyeol finally pushes him away, the both of them breaths ragged. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s lips are wet and swollen, his cheeks flushed, his eyes wide, his mouth open. </p><p>Sungyeol can be possessive, but right now, Woohyun wants Sungyeol, wants him in every way. Sungyeol\u2019s height works, here, as Woohyun holds him against the door, sucking at the side of Sungyeol\u2019s neck, until Sungyeol\u2019s an incoherent mess clutching at Woohyun\u2019s shirt. Woohyun pulls away, presses a soft kiss against the side of his jaw, and another, and another, each one following the next. Heat pools in his body, in the base of his stomach, with every small noise Sungyeol makes, with every small shift of Sungyeol against him, and Woohyun kisses him again and again, and then, in a fit of insanity, slips his hand underneath the elastic of Sungyeol\u2019s waistband, his hand pressing against Sungyeol\u2019s cock, through his underwear still sticky from last night\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s face is buried in his shoulder, and Woohyun presses his head against the cool door, grounding and cold against him. Sungyeol\u2019s sounds, muffled, slide through his shirt and deep into his skin, and Woohyun rubs his fingers against Sungyeol, drags out those sounds until Sungyeol falls limp against him, his arms wrapping around Woohyun\u2019s chest. </p><p>He\u2019s warm. Too warm. </p><p>Woohyun steps away, and he sees Sungyeol stumble. </p><p>\"Have a good day,\" Woohyun says. His voice is less steady than he would\u2019ve liked it to be, and his mind is a mess of unsurety. </p><p>He looks a mess, he knows it. Sungyeol looks a mess, red marks scattered across his skin, and Woohyun doubts he looks much better. Somehow, that matters less than the bewildered look in Sungyeol\u2019s eyes (what do you <i>want</i>), the unsaid words he can nearly see. </p><p>But he can\u2019t stay, and he runs a hand through his hair, and he pushes past Sungyeol and into the empty hallway.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"You want to talk about it?\" </p><p>Woohyun looks up to Kibum perching himself at the edge of his desk. His friend\u2019s hair is blond again, and Woohyun rakes a hand through his own recently dyed hair. </p><p>\"About what?\" he asks. </p><p>\"You didn\u2019t flirt with the waitresses today,\" Kibum laughs, but his eyes are serious. \"No, but really, you doing okay? Did the interview\u2026\" </p><p>Woohyun shakes his head and leans back in his chair. \"It went fine,\" he says. \"I\u2019ve just had a lot on my plate lately.\" </p><p>Kibum pulls a face in sympathy. Woohyun\u2019s told him bits and pieces, more than he\u2019s told anyone else, at least. But not Sungyeol. Never Sungyeol. </p><p>\"I called my mom last night,\" he says. Woohyun\u2019s slipped into Korean, even though the office is mostly empty. </p><p>\"And?\" </p><p>It\u2019s a bad habit, and he shakes his head. </p><p>\"I need some coffee. Come with?\" This time, in English. </p><p>\"Do I need my coat?\" Kibum asks. </p><p>Woohyun hesitates for a moment, then gestures upwards. \"Let\u2019s stay inside.\" </p><p>\"Just the usual,\" Woohyun says, once they get out the door. \"I guess she\u2019s just worried.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s what moms are for,\" Kibum says. </p><p>\"And\u2026\" Woohyun hesitates. He hasn\u2019t thought this through entirely himself\u2014he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s too soon to talk about it, if he shouldn\u2019t mull over it more. But it\u2019s Kibum, and he\u2019s always been close with Kibum. If Woohyun believed in other halves, that\u2019d be it. </p><p>Kibum waits, and Woohyun waits until they\u2019re out of the elevator, because there\u2019s a pair of women making small talk who get off on the same floor. He steps to the side, away from the coffee shop, out of the way. </p><p>His heart is loud. </p><p>\"I\u2019m thinking about moving to Korea.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re <i>what?</i>?\" </p><p>Woohyun grimaces, shaking his head for Kibum to keep his voice down. \"I don\u2019t even know if 'thinking' is the right word for it,\" he says. \"Considering?\" </p><p>\"That means it\u2019s a real possibility.\" Kibum shakes his head. \"You\u2019ll need more than a coffee break to tell me about this.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun laughs dryly. \"Like I said, a lot on my plate.\" </p><p>\"Your mom?\" Kibum asks. He nods towards the coffee shop. Woohyun agrees, and turns down the hall. They should at least return with coffee. </p><p>\"Kind of. They\u2019re planning on moving back, when dad\u2019s finished this project. And you know that my big brother moved back to live with our grandparents in high school, right? So\u2026\" </p><p>\"So it\u2019d be just you here,\" Kibum says. </p><p>Woohyun nods. It wouldn\u2019t make any real difference, not for him. He hasn\u2019t lived <i>with</i> his parents for\u2026how ever many years ago second year of university was, and that\u2019d only been a summer. Really, not since they\u2019d moved to the west coast and to another country and he\u2019d stayed here. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know what to do,\" Woohyun says. \"Even my dad thinks it\u2019s a bad idea, but if everyone\u2019s there, and\u2026\" he trails off, pressing his mouth into a thin line. </p><p>\"Your grandparents?\" </p><p>Woohyun nods. It\u2019s hard to forget how old they\u2019ve become, just as hard it is to remember how old they\u2019ve become. Hard to forget how thin his grandmother\u2019s hand had been in his, how fragile her skin had seemed, and at the same time, hard to remember when it\u2019d happened, or maybe, hard to remember when he\u2019d realised. This, he had mentioned to Kibum. When his father\u2019s father had passed away five years ago, it was the first time someone he\u2019d known had. They hadn\u2019t been that close\u2014they couldn\u2019t have been, not when they\u2019d moved across an ocean when Woohyun had been seven and it was with his mother\u2019s parents he\u2019d stayed with over the summers. But the news had hit him harder than he\u2019d thought it could\u2019ve, like a great, taloned claw had wrapped around his heart and couldn't let go until it\u2019d been torn from every vein and artery in his chest. </p><p><i>You could come with us</i>, his mother had said, and the idea had hit him as hard as the news had. </p><p> \"I know, I know, I\u2019d be throwing away my entire life, my job, my career, my friends, and then there\u2019s the military, I <i>know</i>.\" </p><p>Kibum places a comforting hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, at least you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that job interview,\" he jokes. </p><p>\"Thanks,\" Woohyun says glumly. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s talk about this later?\" Kibum says, and they\u2019re at the counter, and Woohyun nods, and goes to order his medium coffee two milk two sugar, because this isn\u2019t even half of it. </p><p>When it rains, it pours, he\u2019d told Sungyeol. </p><p>It\u2019s raining now. </p><p>Kibum had left to finish up some work he had to do, and Woohyun had lingered in the bar, and he regrets it now that the light drizzle he was sure would clear has turned into a steady rain, defying the weather report\u2019s ten percent chance of precipitation. Ten percent wasn\u2019t zero, and even a zero percent prediction didn\u2019t mean a zero percent chance in reality. It still has a chance to clear, though, and it\u2019s still early, not even eight, so Woohyun gets another beer and sits at the table near the window. </p><p>There\u2019s the job, there\u2019s Korea, and then there\u2019s Sungyeol. </p><p>Sungyeol, who should be the least important of the three. Sungyeol, who Woohyun had firmly placed back into the category of 'friend'. Sungyeol, who Woohyun had been terrible at keeping in that category of 'friend'. </p><p>It was difficult to build a dam, easier to keep it closed, and easiest to break it open. </p><p>But rebuilding it was an entirely different story. </p><p>There\u2019d always be cracks, weakness, small leaks that were forever being patched up, and always the fear that it could come crashing down again.  </p><p>And then there\u2019s Sungyeol, tapping at the window, and what the hell? Think of the devil and the devil will come. </p><p>\"Look at this loser drinking alone.\" Sungyeol shakes off the umbrella and drops into the seat across from Woohyun. </p><p>\"Well now there\u2019s two of us,\" Woohyun replies. </p><p>Sungyeol snorts, flagging over a server and asking for whatever Woohyun\u2019s having.  </p><p>\"You don\u2019t like IPAs,\" Woohyun points out. </p><p>\"Yeah, well I don\u2019t like you,\" Sungyeol shoots back. Woohyun can\u2019t help but laugh at the elementary playground response, and even Sungyeol looks suitably disgusted with his comeback.  </p><p>\"Another late night?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Last one,\" Sungyeol says. He cracks his neck and leans back in the chair and honestly, he does look more relaxed than he\u2019s looked in weeks. </p><p>\"Not out celebrating with the crew?\" </p><p>The corners of Sungyeol\u2019s mouth draw down in reply to that. \"After spending twelve hours a day with them for the past week? No thanks.\" He pauses, and whatever he\u2019s about to say next clearly pains him, from the scowl on his face. \"The break was good.\" </p><p>Woohyun lets out a puff of self-satisfied laughter. \"I\u2019m always right,\" he says smugly.  </p><p>\"Yeah, yeah, whatever\u2014thank you,\" Sungyeol says, as his beer arrives. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re celebrating with me instead?\" </p><p>\"Don\u2019t flatter yourself,\" Sungyeol says. \"I\u2019ll be celebrating alone with a good night\u2019s sleep.\" </p><p>\"There are so many things I could say to that but I won\u2019t, because I\u2019m nice,\" Woohyun says, chuckling. Sungyeol glares at him, sipping at his beer. His nose instantly wrinkles in distaste, and Woohyun bursts out laughing. </p><p>\"Gimme that,\" he says, reaching for Sungyeol\u2019s beer, still held midair.  </p><p>\"Hey, I\u2019m drinking this!\" </p><p>\"No you\u2019re not, I am,\" Woohyun says to Sungyeol, and then to the passing server: \"an amber ale, please.\" </p><p>Sungyeol grudgingly relinquishes his hold, and Woohyun drains his glass and pulls Sungyeol\u2019s in front of him. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not carrying you home if you drink too much,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"I\u2019m not you,\" Woohyun says sweetly. He pulls his legs out of the way before Sungyeol has a chance to kick them\u2014he ends up kicking the chair instead, and just desserts and all that. </p><p>\"You want to order food?\" Woohyun asks, after Sungyeol\u2019s settled down and stopped sulking. \"Have you eaten?\" </p><p>\"Sushi again, worked late,\" Sungyeol says. He shrugs. \"Only good thing about end of quarters.\" </p><p>\"The overtime pay can\u2019t hurt,\" Woohyun says. The server returns, and Woohyun gestures towards Sungyeol. Woohyun\u2019s never tried this one before, but whatever it is, Sungyeol prefers it to 'whatever he was having' because he lets out a content sigh as he puts down his glass. </p><p>\"Could be worse,\" Sungyeol agrees.  </p><p>\"So where were you going?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Huh?\" </p><p>Woohyun nods towards the darkened streets. \"You missed the subway by a good block,\" he says. </p><p>\"Oh. That.\" Sungyeol\u2019s face darkens\u2014except that\u2019s not it, really. One corner of his mouth pulls outwards a little, his eyes take on a nearly sullen look, his shoulders tense, and Woohyun knows that this isn\u2019t something Sungyeol wants to talk about, and that it isn\u2019t his place to pry. </p><p>\"But good thing you missed the subway because now you don\u2019t have to miss me,\" Woohyun sing-songs. He probably definitely deserves the sharp kick to the shins he receives, even if it does hurt like a bitch. </p><p>\"God, will you ever be less annoying?\" </p><p>\"You love it,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>Sungyeol snorts in disbelief, taking a long pull from his beer. </p><p>\"Did you get dumped?\" he asks, after. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart jumps, as he processes Sungyeol\u2019s words. No, yes, I. He blinks. Because he\u2019s sitting alone. \"Of course not, who\u2019d dump me?\" he says. </p><p>\"Everyone,\" Sungyeol says bluntly. Woohyun winces. Too close to home. He\u2019d certainly never been the one doing the dumping. </p><p>\"If you mean Kibum, he left to finish work,\" Woohyun says, keeping his voice light. \"Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not breaking up any time soon.\" </p><p>Something flashes over Sungyeol\u2019s face and disappears just as quickly, as his brows shoot up in disbelief. \"Is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\" he says. </p><p>\"Because I tell you everything, right?\" and it\u2019s a little too sharp but either Sungyeol doesn\u2019t notice or Sungyeol doesn\u2019t care, and whichever it is, Woohyun\u2019ll take it. </p><p>\"That would imply we were friends,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun\u2019s stomach twists itself into knots that has nothing to do with the beer. </p><p>\"Or that you were my diary\u2014which I think I might prefer,\" Woohyun says.  </p><p>Sungyeol gags. \"Ugh, I don\u2019t want to know all your dirty thoughts.\" </p><p>\"Good thing I don\u2019t keep a diary,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d prefer that I didn\u2019t exist?\" </p><p>\"No! No, what?\" Woohyun answers too quickly, and then back pedals because Sungyeol\u2019s laughing, and then wishes he hadn\u2019t done that either, because the look Sungyeol\u2019s giving him is far too piercing for his liking, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t have a fast response, and maybe it\u2019s because three beers do tend to slow down thought processes. </p><p>Woohyun doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s grateful for the silence that takes over instead, and they\u2019re just two men in their twenties at a table near the window, each nursing their own beer. The rain hasn\u2019t quite let up, and Sungyeol was right about one thing\u2014that they were friends. </p><p>Friends who end up slipping into Woohyun\u2019s apartment, the lights already off, and Sungyeol\u2019s hand brushes too accidentally against Woohyun\u2019s thigh. </p><p>\"Sunggyu\u2019s sleeping,\" Woohyun murmurs. The apartment is dark, but they both know their way around, when it\u2019s dark, because none of this is new. So Sungyeol drags Woohyun to the bathroom, where the door is the thickest and the running water of the shower masks the sounds Sungyeol makes, when Woohyun\u2019s fingers trace dangerously close against the inside of Sungyeol\u2019s thigh. But Woohyun can\u2019t shower forever, and Sungyeol <i>can</i> be quiet, if he tries, but Woohyun presses a hand over his mouth anyway as his fingers circle Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and Sungyeol\u2019s tongue is hot against his palm. Woohyun wipes his hand against Sungyeol\u2019s arm, shooting him a look of disgust\u2014Sungyeol grabs Woohyun\u2019s shoulder and pulls him close, his mouth hot as they kiss, and fuck, fuck fuck <i>fuck</i> Woohyun feels like he could come from just this, from just the way Sungyeol uses his mouth, how he\u2019s learned to use his mouth, and he doesn\u2019t know how he keeps it together, how he keeps himself tangled up and cohesive and just conscious enough to know how to touch Sungyeol so he\u2019s whining into him and on the edge and so he feels <i>good</i> but maybe that\u2019s just something he\u2019s learned and can never forget. He\u2019s barely taken Sungyeol into his mouth when there\u2019s fingers pulling at his hair and when Woohyun glances up, still sucking Sungyeol through his orgasm, Sungyeol\u2019s biting his fist to keep from crying out and <i>fuck</i> Woohyun already knows that\u2019s what he\u2019ll be remembering when he touches himself for the next week, at least. But Sungyeol jerks him off rough and fast and Woohyun doesn\u2019t have time to think, doesn\u2019t have time to look before his come spills over both their stomachs, and Woohyun knows he\u2019ll be showering in the morning again, for sure. </p><p>He does, in the morning\u2014this time, alone.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sunlight floods through the window, because Woohyun forgot to close the blinds, again. It wakes him, the unfamiliar warmth of someone next to him bringing him the rest of the way. The covers are kicked halfway off, because they\u2019re a little too heavy for this kind of late spring, and because Sungyeol might as well be a furnace. His finger brushes against Sungyeol\u2019s skin, not quite sure if he\u2019s real. </p><p>Thin fingers wrap around his wrist, and Woohyun turns his head to see Sungyeol, eyes open, an uncharacteristically soft smile on his face.  </p><p>\"Awake?\" Sungyeol says. His voice is still a little rough, and Woohyun reaches up to brush his hand against Sungyeol\u2019s face, but stops, hand falling against Sungyeol\u2019s arm instead. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. \"Yeah, I am.\" </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hair is mussed, and there\u2019s a faint mark in stark contrast against his pale skin, nestled in the crook of his shoulder. His hair falls messy over his eyes, but it\u2019s Sungyeol who brushes Woohyun\u2019s hair from his face. It\u2019s Sungyeol who rolls over, catching Woohyun\u2019s lips in a slow kiss. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart pounds in his chest. </p><p>Sungyeol kisses him, slow and patient, and Woohyun\u2019s eyes are half open, and Sungyeol\u2019s are closed, and one of his hands is still on his wrist and the other rests against the side of his jaw. He\u2019s so <i>close</i> and Woohyun feels like he can\u2019t breathe, like if he breathes Sungyeol will disappear, Sungyeol will pull away, face twisted in disgust, because Sungyeol has never liked being touched\u2014but Sungyeol is patient (he\u2019s never patient) and Woohyun\u2019s world narrows to the incessant pressure (pleasure) of Sungyeol\u2019s mouth against his. </p><p>It\u2019s like the first time, and it\u2019s nothing like the first time, because the first time had been rough and messy and Woohyun\u2019s hand sliding down Sungyeol\u2019s leg and Sungyeol with his back to the room and everyone sleeping in it and Sungyeol had kissed him desperately, like it was something wrong, like it was a crime to be hidden from the world and it was, it had been, and when Sungyeol had come, Woohyun had pressed his hand over his mouth because Myungsoo\u2014<i>Myungsoo</i>\u2014had stirred and rolled over and Sungyeol couldn\u2019t\u2014<i>couldn\u2019t</i>\u2014wake them.  </p><p>But this is the morning sun pouring in through the windows, and Woohyun\u2019s hand rests against the small of Sungyeol\u2019s back, and he catches Sungyeol\u2019s lips between his, and he\u2019s too solid, too warm, too close to not be real.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Should\u2019ve brought an umbrella,\" Howon comments. Woohyun shivers lightly as he glances up at the clouds in the dark sky. It\u2019s barely raining, more of a drizzle really. </p><p>\"It said nothing about rain,\" Sungyeol says sullenly. His face is half buried in his scarf, and his hands are deep in his pockets. He needs a haircut, and his ears are pink. </p><p>\"Pretty sure it mentioned some precipitation,\" Woohyun comments mildly. </p><p>\"Yeah, <i>snow</i>,\" Sungyeol says. \"White, fluffy, not wet?\" </p><p>\"I know what snow is,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>They\u2019re heading down to the mall to see the new action comedy movie, and Woohyun wishes he\u2019d suggested the subway, because Sungyeol is cranky when he\u2019s wet. Kibum\u2019s checking times on his phone, and to be honest, Woohyun\u2019s a little too cold to deal with Sungyeol right now. He should\u2019ve brought a heavier coat, is what he should\u2019ve brought, never mind the umbrella. </p><p>\"You want 3D?\" Kibum asks. \"Should we grab dinner before or after?\" </p><p>\"When\u2019s the next showing?\" Woohyun asks. He hangs back a few steps and Kibum hands him his phone.  </p><p>\"Six forty five, seven thirty, take your pick,\" Kibum says. </p><p>\"Six forty five and dinner after,\" Howon says, then laughs. \"If Myungsoo had made it he\u2019d probably want dinner twice.\" </p><p>\"Is that 3D?\" Sungyeol asks. He tugs the phone from Woohyun\u2019s hand, scrolling down the screen, all of them huddled around it, as they walk. \"Oh, that animal movie\u2019s out too.\" </p><p>\"We could see that next week,\" Howon suggests. A notification pops up and Kibum takes his phone back from Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Hang on, I need to take this,\" Kibum says\u2014work call, he means. He nods at Howon and Sungyeol. \"Get the tickets, we\u2019ll catch up.\" </p><p>Woohyun glances at the time on his own phone\u2014they were cutting it close, if they wanted to make the six forty five.  </p><p>\"Sure,\" Howon says. </p><p>\"You can pay for mine,\" Woohyun tells Sungyeol sweetly. </p><p>\"Something you\u2019re not telling us?\" Howon wolf whistles, and Sungyeol looks ready to kill Woohyun. </p><p>\"Get your own ticket,\" Sungyeol says. \"We\u2019re only getting one extra.\" </p><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll cover,\" Howon calls out, as he drags Sungyeol away. </p><p>Woohyun tucks his hands in his pockets as he waits for Kibum to finish up his call. </p><p>\"Everything fine?\" he asks. </p><p>\"Yeah, Amber said she\u2019ll take care of it,\" he says, putting away his phone. He gives Woohyun a sharp sideways glance\u2014Woohyun\u2019s eyebrows shoot up as he looks at him quizzically. </p><p>\"Something on my face?\" he asks. </p><p>\"It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\" </p><p>Woohyun feels his heart drop out of his chest. </p><p>\"It\u2019s who?\" he says. He begins to walk away, but Kibum grabs his arm, forcing him to slow down, and Woohyun knows he\u2019s not getting out of this one. </p><p>\"<i>It\u2019s who?</i>\" Kibum echoes in disbelief. He nods down the sidewalk, where Sungyeol and Howon have already disappeared behind the crowds. \"You know who!\" </p><p>\"Can\u2019t say I know Voldemort,\" Woohyun says lightly. </p><p>\"Woohyun, I swear\u2014\" </p><p>\"Look, we\u2019re just friends, okay?\" Woohyun snaps. He pulls away from Kibum and walks faster, but Kibum catches up in a few steps and matches his pace. Not now, not now, not now, he thinks. Small drops of rain hit his skin, linger in his hair. </p><p>\"Damn, you weren\u2019t kidding about a lot on your plate,\" Kibum says quietly. </p><p>\"We\u2019re not talking about this,\" Woohyun says. \"Please. Sungyeol\u2019s a friend, that\u2019s it.\" </p><p>Kibum laughs softly. \"Your love sick puppy dog face says something different.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019d rather think of it as a lovable puppy\u2014\" </p><p>\"Woohyun.\" </p><p>\"Kibum,\" Woohyun says, matching Kibum\u2019s tone with a mock serious one.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m serious,\" Kibum says, and Woohyun\u2019s not getting out of this one. \"And why didn\u2019t you tell me? Out of all people\u2026\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s no good way to say 'hey by the way Sungyeol and I are banging'?\" Woohyun\u2019s voice drops into a low hiss. </p><p>\"Wait you\u2019re\u2014\" From the look on Kibum\u2019s face and his aborted question, he hadn\u2019t even entertained the idea it\u2019d gone that far, that he\u2019d probably thought Woohyun was caught up in some hopeless, empty crush. </p><p>Woohyun wants to laugh, but it gets stuck somewhere between horror and regret. It\u2019d <i>started</i> from that far, and they\u2019d gotten here instead.  </p><p>\"But you\u2019re just friends,\" Kibum says flatly. </p><p>\"That\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\" The cat's out of the bag, might as well give up the ghost, but Woohyun clings desperately to the last remnants at the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box. Kibum\u2019d caught him off guard, and Woohyun\u2019s always been good on his feet, but he\u2019s not sure anyone\u2019s ready for their best friend to spring their deepest secrets on them. \"We\u2019re friends.\" </p><p>\"With benefits?\" Kibum asks, and yeah, yes, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it is, and Woohyun nods, not trusting himself to speak. After all, they sure as hell weren\u2019t boyfriends, and if not that, then what were they?  </p><p>Kibum blows out a long disbelieving breath. \"Either you\u2019re lying to yourself or you\u2019re really that stupid, and Nam Woohyun you are the furthest thing from stupid.\" </p><p>Their conversation has carried them through the crowds and to the entrance of the theater, Woohyun\u2019s pace cutting down the time to nearly half their usual leisurely pace. </p><p>\"What do you want me to say?\" Woohyun says, voice low as Kibum pushes in close after him through the doors. \"Yes, I\u2019m lying to myself, yes, I probably have some disgusting love sick puppy dog face going on, and <i>yes</i> I still have far more feelings than I should?\" and this is too much, too many things Kibum didn\u2019t need to know. </p><p>\"Hey, what\u2019re you two lovebirds talking about?\" Howon yells, and Woohyun blows a kiss at Kibum, and definitely doesn\u2019t look at Sungyeol as he jogs to join their friends. </p><p>Kibum shoots him sharp looks the entire night, as Woohyun drapes an arm around Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders, as Woohyun laughs at Sungyeol\u2019s terrible joke, as Woohyun teases Sungyeol until Sungyeol shoves a handful of popcorn down Woohyun\u2019s shirt. But even Kibum isn\u2019t going to put a damper on the good mood, and no one disagrees when Woohyun invites themselves over to Sungyeol\u2019s place afterwards, because Sungyeol has a PS4 and lives alone. Besides, Woohyun says, he\u2019s pretty sure Sunggyu\u2019d said he had 'someone over' and Woohyun\u2019s fine with giving that 'someone' some space. Howon says next time, but Kibum agrees a little too readily.  </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hand lingers a little too long on his leg as they ride the subway up, and Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches. The ground is soaked and the air is wet with a long gone storm, and all that\u2019s left is the night chill of an autumn that\u2019s nearly spilled into winter. Drinking games aren\u2019t quite as fun with three people, but they manage, and maybe Woohyun is a little drunker than he really is and even Kibum has to go home, eventually\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hand is on Woohyun\u2019s thigh and Woohyun tangles his fingers in Sungyeol\u2019s hair, and kisses him without warning, but Sungyeol doesn\u2019t need it, not when this is the only thing they\u2019ve been waiting for all night, all evening, all\u2014 </p><p>They\u2019re both breathing hard when they pull away, and Sungyeol\u2019s cheeks are flushed from a little more than just the past few minutes. </p><p>\"Let\u2019s get you to bed,\" Woohyun says, because Woohyun might not have been as drunk as he\u2019d seemed, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been a bit of a lightweight.  </p><p>\"Come here,\" Sungyeol says, and he tugs Woohyun back down, catches him in another long kiss, and god Woohyun needs him but he pulls Sungyeol to his feet. </p><p>\"Bed,\" Woohyun says firmly. Sungyeol whines, but Sungyeol is also a stick, and it\u2019s too easy to haul him to his room, push him into his bed. He <i>is</i> drunk, because he rolls over onto his side and seems half asleep already, and an ache grows in Woohyun\u2019s chest, but no, not like this, never like this. Not when Sungyeol has room to regret it in the morning. The faint aura of disappointment settles about him, but Sungyeol\u2019s couch isn\u2019t uncomfortable, and he\u2019s slept there before, but as he\u2019s pulling the covers over Sungyeol, Sungyeol grabs his arm, and it catches him by surprise. </p><p>\"Where are you going?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Nowhere,\" Woohyun says. \"You\u2019re going to sleep.\" </p><p>He shakes Sungyeol off, but Sungyeol just wraps an arm about Woohyun\u2019s waist, and Sungyeol is a stick but Sungyeol\u2019s been working out without him, and it\u2019s enough to pull Woohyun onto the bed, tumbling on top of Sungyeol. Sungyeol\u2019s elbow jabs into Woohyun\u2019s stomach, until Sungyeol pulls that arm out and throws that arm around Woohyun too. </p><p>\"Sleep with me,\" Sungyeol says, and he nuzzles into Woohyun\u2019s neck. </p><p>And. Fine. Fine\u2014 \"Just sleep,\" Woohyun says, and he means it. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up, half of him cold, the other half blanketed under Sungyeol. It\u2019s still night, not a hint of sun outside the window, and he glances at Sungyeol still asleep. He remembers waking up to an empty bed, but he also remembers waking up to Sungyeol. He slides a little closer to Sungyeol, pulls the covers back over them both, and Sungyeol is warm. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know when he falls asleep, but he knows he wakes up to Sungyeol staring at him, hair messy, eyes still bleary from sleep. </p><p>\"Awake?\" Sungyeol says, and his voice is rough and hoarse. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says, and clears his throat. \"Sort of.\" </p><p>This close, Woohyun can see the faint lines of exhaustion about Sungyeol\u2019s eyes, the shadows underneath. He\u2019s lost weight, and Woohyun remembers Sungyeol from university with soft cheeks and a soft stomach but now he\u2019s all sharp angles and he needs more sleep. Sungyeol is closer, and closer, and when Woohyun doesn\u2019t move, Sungyeol\u2019s hand is on his shoulder and he\u2019s kissing Woohyun, wet and sloppy. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s awake, but only sort of, but he\u2019s okay with this, okay with Sungyeol taking the lead as he slides his hand up Sungyeol\u2019s back, under his shirt. He kisses back lazily, until he\u2019s teasing, and he smiles a smile no one can see when Sungyeol whines, kissing him harder and more desperate. He keeps it slow, his hand creeping up to Sungyeol\u2019s neck, and he runs his fingers through Sungyeol\u2019s hair. Sungyeol\u2019s fingers are bruising against his skin, and he bites down against Woohyun\u2019s lip. Woohyun jerks away, and Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is curled in a self satisfied smirk.  </p><p>\"You fucker,\" Woohyun breathes\u2014then crushes Sungyeol to him, and there\u2019s still the faint smell of alcohol, but this close it doesn\u2019t matter, not with Sungyeol\u2019s mouth so hot against his. Sungyeol pulls at his hair, and Woohyun digs his fingers into Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder as he kisses Sungyeol. </p><p>And it feels so <i>good</i>, every bit of it, every bit of him, and from the way Sungyeol rubs against him, he knows it\u2019s good for Sungyeol too. His body is hot, and the blankets tangle between their legs when Woohyun pulls Sungyeol over until they\u2019re both on their sides. </p><p>It seems an eternity when they pull away, Woohyun\u2019s hand lingering fond against Sungyeol\u2019s face, and the slight curl of a smile rests on the corner of Sungyeol\u2019s lips. The world is still gray behind the blinds, but it\u2019s almost winter and the sun rises ever later. </p><p>\"Good morning,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol laughs. </p><p>\"God, I need coffee,\" Sungyeol groans as he sits up. </p><p>\"Should\u2019ve had more water,\" Woohyun says. He lies there for a moment more, watches Sungyeol shuffle his way to the edge of the bed. He shucks off his clothes from last night, and Woohyun tears his eyes away from that back, and the already purpling mark he\u2019d left on Sungyeol\u2019s skin. </p><p>\"Too late for that,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun gets up too. </p><p>He\u2019s still wearing last night\u2019s clothes, and he yawns as he smoothes down his hair. </p><p>\"Do you want a change?\" Sungyeol asks him. He\u2019s dressed in a loose tee and pair of shorts, and he nods at Woohyun\u2019s rumpled clothes. </p><p>\"It\u2019s alright,\" Woohyun says, but Sungyeol\u2019s already tossing him a clean shirt and jeans, the ones that actually fit him.  </p><p>\"You better wash them before you give them back,\" Sungyeol says, and then he\u2019s disappeared into the bathroom. </p><p>Woohyun changes, because there\u2019s no point not to, and he folds his own clothes and stuffs it in his bag, still tossed onto the floor next to Sungyeol\u2019s couch. His phone is there too, and it\u2019s down to 10% battery, but it\u2019s enough to know it\u2019s not even nine. He wanders into Sungyeol\u2019s kitchen, and fills the kettle. It takes him a few minutes to find the coffee, and by that time, Sungyeol\u2019s out of the bathroom and he grabs the grinder from the counter. </p><p>\"What do you want for breakfast?\" Sungyeol asks. </p><p>\"Just coffee,\" Woohyun says. \"I told Sunggyu I\u2019d do the groceries this week.\" </p><p>\"This early?\" Sungyeol asks, surprised. </p><p>\"Better early than late,\" Woohyun says. He leans against the counter as Sungyeol makes a pour over, pushing over Woohyun\u2019s mug before making himself one. Woohyun sips at his coffee, hot, watching the lines of Sungyeol\u2019s arms as he directs the water in a steady stream. The kitchen smells like coffee, and by the time Woohyun leaves, he too smells like coffee.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol is sharp elbows and angry glances this morning, and Woohyun remembers this from university, hair stuck up on the wrong side and shirt a little too rumpled from having spent the night under a pile of textbooks. There\u2019s bags under his eyes and the whites of them are more red than anything else, and Woohyun knows that sooner or later he\u2019s going to snap. </p><p>\"Eat,\" Woohyun tells him, shoving the fresh bagels he\u2019d picked up on the way here into Sungyeol\u2019s arms. </p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" </p><p>\"You look like shit,\" Woohyun says, and it\u2019s probably the wrong thing to say. He sighs, pushes his hair back, shakes his head. \"Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that.\" </p><p>\"You\u2019re not wrong,\" Sungyeol says sharply. \"You didn\u2019t answer my question.\" </p><p>\"You didn\u2019t reply to my texts,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Since when did you care?\" </p><p>\"Since when did I\u2014look, just eat, alright?\" </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s seen this enough to know he hasn\u2019t slept, he hasn\u2019t eaten, at least not properly or regularly, and he\u2019s still in the doorway, Sungyeol\u2019s eyes as sharp as daggers. </p><p>\"Call if you need anything,\" Woohyun says. He leaves before Sungyeol can kick him out. </p><p>\"Hm? No, nothing's wrong?\" Myungsoo'd said when he'd called, three days after the last time he'd gotten hold of Sungyeol. </p><p>\"Never mind,\" Woohyun had quickly said. \"He's probably just busy.\" </p><p>(He's probably just ignoring me.) </p><p>But Sungyeol shows up at his apartment two days later and he's brought take-out. He doesn't look much better, but Woohyun's learned not to press, because press too hard on anything and it'll inevitably shatter. He hovers on the edge of staying and leaving, but Woohyun's missed him and he sits a little closer to him than he needs to, and rests his hand on his shoulder, on his leg, on his arm until Sungyeol's shrugging him off every few seconds. But Sungyeol does stay, and he does climb into bed with Woohyun. </p><p>He's warm against Woohyun's chest, and in the darkness of Woohyun's room, he doesn't push him away, but nor does he pull him closer. Woohyun fumbles under the covers, blind, for Sungyeol's fingers, clutches both their hands to Sungyeol's chest. Sungyeol's awake, he can tell from his staggered breaths, from the stiffness in his shoulders. </p><p>In the end, Woohyun draws away, and sleeps facing Sungyeol's back. </p><p>There's an unnerving familiarity here, only this time, there's so much more to lose. </p><p>And Sungyeol does call, and 'come over', he says, and that's all the prompting Woohyun needs to grab his coat and his keys and the subway ride over seems longer than usual. Did you need anything, Woohyun had asked, but Sungyeol had said no, just come over, and here he was, Sungyeol kissing him before the door's even closed. </p><p>He's lost weight, not that he ever has much weight to lose, and his bones seem sharper than usual. Woohyun needs to drag him to the gym again, but Sungyeol\u2019s been busy, lately. He leans into Woohyun's touch, but there's a touch of hesitation, a touch of exhaustion, and when Woohyun pulls away, Sungyeol doesn't stop him. </p><p>The light's off, but when Woohyun reaches for the switch, Sungyeol stops him, hand on his. </p><p>\"Talk to me,\" Woohyun says, and it's quiet, because the room is quiet, and the darkness swallows all. </p><p>\"It's nothing,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun wants to scream that no, it's not nothing, but that's not Woohyun, and he doesn't. </p><p>\"Is it me?\" Woohyun asks, and Sungyeol snorts, then stands. </p><p>\"Don't flatter yourself,\" he says.  </p><p>\"Can I\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, you can't,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun wonders if Sungyeol means 'no, you can't help,' or 'no, you can't do anything,' or just 'no, you can't', something so broad and overreaching that Woohyun can only sit on the edge of the couch while Sungyeol stands in the middle of the room, a shadow shrouded in shadows. </p><p>\"Alright,\" Woohyun says. The crouch creaks as he comes to stand behind Sungyeol. He hovers, unsure if it's a 'no, you can't touch me,' or 'no, you can't come closer,' but Sungyeol doesn't pull away when Woohyun gathers him to his chest. \"Alright, but I'll be here,\" he says, and suddenly, he wonders if what Sungyeol had meant was 'no, you can't make me feel better, because it <i>is</i> you', and the room's too dark for Woohyun to know which one is the lie.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Winter bowls in without warning, and the city is buried in snow the first week of December. </p><p>It\u2019s cold enough that the snow\u2019s not going anywhere any time soon, but not cold enough that the mid-day sun won\u2019t melt it mid-day, only for it to freeze over during the night. The sidewalks are salted liberally, but by the time evening rolls around, a patch of black ice still pulls Sungyeol\u2019s feet from under him, and he\u2019s lucky he hits the ground back first, not head first, his bag taking the brunt of the fall. </p><p>\"<i>Ice</i>?\" Woohyun laughs, when he shows up some fifteen minutes later, after he calls Woohyun to fend off concerned onlookers. \"Really?\" </p><p>Sungyeol is sitting on the steps outside the shopping center, and Woohyun reassures the two young women hovering near him that he\u2019ll take Sungyeol to a doctor or the hospital, because it looked like he\u2019d hit his head pretty hard. He\u2019d definitely blacked out for a few moments, they told him in hushed voices. </p><p>\"Shut up,\" Sungyeol grumbles. \"It\u2019s not like I could see it.\" </p><p>\"Can you stand?\" Woohyun asks. He holds a hand out, and he\u2019s not sure if Sungyeol will take it, but he does. He sways a little unsteadily, but stays on his feet. Sungyeol gingerly brushes the back of his head, his face contorting into pain when he does. Woohyun\u2019s chest constricts, and he grips Sungyeol\u2019s hand tighter.  </p><p>\"Good thing you can\u2019t get any dumber,\" Woohyun jokes\u2014but when Sungyeol pulls away to retort, he nearly falls before Woohyun grabs him about the waist. \"Okay, we\u2019re going to the doctor.\" </p><p>\"I just hit my head,\" Sungyeol says, but he doesn\u2019t stop Woohyun from calling a cab. </p><p>There\u2019s not much to do but rest, and like hell he\u2019s letting Sungyeol go home to an empty apartment. He calls Myungsoo, because Myungsoo would\u2019ve killed him if he hadn\u2019t. Myungsoo lives north of the city, but half an hour later he\u2019s at their door. </p><p>\"You slipped on <i>ice</i>?\" Myungsoo laughs as soon as he\u2019s reassured himself that no, Sungyeol hasn\u2019t lost his memories and that yes, other than his wounded pride, he\u2019s alright. </p><p>\"You too?\" Sungyeol asks in disbelief. \"It was dark!\" </p><p>\"Be more careful,\" Sunggyu says. He\u2019s sitting at the kitchen table, laptop in front of him. Sungyeol\u2019s become a regular presence in their apartment again, and Sunggyu\u2019s the one who\u2019d suggested Sungyeol stay with them for a few days. </p><p>Woohyun had wanted to stay with Sungyeol for a few days, but he couldn\u2019t say that. </p><p>Sunggyu offers Sungyeol Woohyun\u2019s bed, like it\u2019s perfectly normal to offer up someone else\u2019s bed, but Woohyun would\u2019ve anyway. Woohyun says he\u2019ll take the sleeping bag, but Sungyeol glances at him, and no, Woohyun won\u2019t be using the sleeping bag and they both know it. Myungsoo leaves before the subway stops, promising that yes, he\u2019ll be careful, and yes, he\u2019ll text them when he gets home. </p><p>It isn\u2019t until the lights are off and the door\u2019s closed and Sungyeol\u2019s lying in bed that Woohyun lets loose a shuddering breath. </p><p>\"Fuck, you scared me,\" Woohyun says. He lies down next to Sungyeol, wraps his arms around him, hours of tension draining away, and Sungyeol\u2019s the one who cries easily, not him. </p><p>\"I just slipped,\" Sungyeol says. He pats Woohyun\u2019s arm, and it\u2019s so awkwardly reassuring that Woohyun has to laugh. </p><p>\"Your thick skull was good for something,\" Woohyun says. \"Myungsoo was so worried you\u2019d become amnesiac.\" </p><p>\"The first thing I\u2019d forget is you,\" Sungyeol says. After a moment: \"I didn\u2019t mean that.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"I only called you because you live close.\" </p><p>\"I know.\" </p><p>\"I\u2026\" </p><p>\"I know,\" Woohyun says. He places his hand over Sungyeol\u2019s still resting against his arm, still resting over his heart. \"I know.\" </p><p>Sungyeol is still sleeping when Woohyun wakes, but just let him rest, he\u2019d been told. He slips out into the living room, where Sunggyu is already dressed and ready to go. </p><p>\"You\u2019re staying home?\" Sunggyu asks. </p><p>\"Yeah, I\u2019ll let them know I\u2019m working from home and remote in,\" Woohyun says. \"Myungsoo said he\u2019ll take care of things on Sungyeol\u2019s side.\" </p><p>Sunggyu nods. He pauses by the door, his hand on the door knob. </p><p>\"He\u2019s lucky to have friends like you two,\" he says. </p><p>\"Anyone\u2019s lucky to have me,\" Woohyun laughs. </p><p>He sets up camp on the couch, keeping an eye on Sungyeol through the open door to his room. </p><p>Come get me, Sungyeol had said, when Woohyun had picked up the phone. His words had been slurred, and Woohyun\u2019s heart had dropped. I fell, Sungyeol had said, and that doesn\u2019t make Woohyun feel any better. </p><p>Friends, Woohyun reminds himself. They\u2019re just friends.  </p><p>\"Woohyun?\" </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s voice is soft from his bedroom. </p><p>Woohyun nearly knocks his laptop onto the floor in his haste to stand. </p><p>\"Feeling better?\" he asks, walking\u2014walking\u2014to his room. He leans against the doorframe. </p><p>\"No,\" Sungyeol says. \"I feel like shit.\" </p><p>\"You look like shit,\" Woohyun agrees. He doesn\u2019t, not really, just a little tired, tucked under his blankets. </p><p>\"Asshole,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Takes one to know one,\" Woohyun says. \"How\u2019s your head?\" </p><p>\"It hurts,\" Sungyeol says, and Sungyeol\u2019s always been straightforward, but this is a straightforward Woohyun\u2019s not used to, a raw sort of straightforward. </p><p>\"I\u2019ll get you some Advil,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s drifted back to sleep in the few minutes it takes to find the bottle and pour a cup of water. He\u2019s half on his side, and he\u2019s burrowed deeper into the blankets. Woohyun doesn\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s cold outside. </p><p>He sleeps for the rest of the day, more or less, waking up long enough to take the Advil Woohyun left on his bedside table.  </p><p>By the third day, he\u2019s mostly awake, and generally irritable, and Woohyun feels like he could cry from relief.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\" Sungyeol says. \"Stop hovering, you\u2019re worse than my mom.\" </p><p>\"I could always call your mom,\" Woohyun says\u2014Sungyeol shudders. \"See, not worse than your mom.\" </p><p>\"At least she cooks better than you,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Says the person eating my cooking.\" </p><p>\"Better than nothing,\" Sungyeol says, but he\u2019s still tired. </p><p>It doesn\u2019t stop him from pulling Woohyun over that night, and Woohyun\u2019s body responds before his mind does. </p><p>\"You should\u2014\" be resting, Woohyun says, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been a little too reckless, and when Sungyeol kisses him, he kisses back.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The rain is incessant. </p><p>Woohyun knows he must look crazy, standing at the side of the street, no umbrella, soaked.  </p><p>But it\u2019s also the middle of the night and it\u2019s raining and this is a side street in the middle of a residential quarter and no one\u2019s crazy enough to be outside, so there\u2019s no one to see him, standing across from the apartment building he\u2019s just left, staring at the light in the window.  </p><p><i>Is this your idea of comforting me?</i> Sungyeol\u2019s face, twisted into a sneer. </p><p>Yes, no, not that\u2014<i>can\u2019t figure out how to insult me?</i>, he\u2019d said, and fucking hell Nam Woohyun what had <i>that</i> been about. Fuck, he hadn\u2019t been able to do anything. Not tonight, not last week, not last month, not ever. He wants to tell himself it\u2019s just because Sungyeol won\u2019t let him in, but that\u2019s not it either, is it? It\u2019s because Woohyun doesn\u2019t know how. Doesn\u2019t know how to comfort him, doesn\u2019t know what to say to him, doesn\u2019t know how to navigate him, doesn\u2019t know how to navigate his anger, instead of making it all worse. Doesn\u2019t know how to not say all the awful things he\u2019d said. </p><p>Sungyeol had been crying. Just before he\u2019d slammed the door, Sungyeol had been crying. </p><p>By the time the rain stops, the sun has nearly risen, and Woohyun knows he should probably go home.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Christmas songs play incessantly on the radio and in stores and in Sungyeol singing them off-tune just to piss Sunggyu off, Woohyun\u2019s pretty sure, until Sunggyu threatens to lock him out of the apartment and never let him back in. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t push him, he might actually do it,\" Woohyun laughs, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from joining in.  </p><p>Sunggyu spends a lot of the time out of the apartment anyway, and Sungyeol spends nearly as much time in their apartment as his own. There are the lingering headaches, but Sungyeol really is fine. Sungyeol also doesn\u2019t push him away when Woohyun joins him on the couch, shoulder to shoulder, nor does he shy away from Woohyun\u2019s touches. Woohyun had gone to Sungyeol\u2019s apartment when he\u2019d been out cold to get him a few sets of clothes, and they join a few stray shirts in the bottom drawer that Sungyeol had forgotten here months ago. It makes it easier for Sungyeol to go home with Woohyun after work, instead of to his own apartment. It\u2019s good he doesn\u2019t have a dog, Sungyeol says one day out of the blue, and Woohyun has no clue what he means and tells him as much. </p><p>\"Never mind,\" Sungyeol says, and it\u2019s hard to mind, when Sungyeol has his hand down Woohyun\u2019s pants. </p><p>\"I\u2019m in the middle of cooking!\" Woohyun laughs and pushes Sungyeol off. </p><p>They don\u2019t get as far as doing the dishes, before Woohyun leans over the back of the couch, leans over Sungyeol\u2019s shoulder, and turns his head for a kiss. </p><p>\"I\u2026mmm\u2026was going\u2026to ask you to\u2026do\u2026the dishes,\" Woohyun says, words murmured against Sungyeol\u2019s lips in brief moments of pause. </p><p>\"Stop talking,\" Sungyeol says. His fingers tangle in Woohyun\u2019s hair, tugging lightly as they twist, his mouth still playing against Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>\"Rich, coming from you,\" Woohyun says. He lets Sungyeol pull him over, and it\u2019s awkward, hanging half off the couch. He has to push Sungyeol away, laughing, so he can sit up. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t I say to shut up?\" Sungyeol says. Woohyun loops his arms around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, smiling into Sungyeol\u2019s kiss. Sungyeol got his hair cut a few days ago, and it\u2019s unfamiliarly short when Woohyun runs his fingers through it. It\u2019ll be Christmas soon, and Woohyun knows that Sungyeol\u2019s going to spend it with his family, three hours west. It\u2019s an uncomfortable angle, leaning backwards, twisted to his left, and he rearranges them, pushing Sungyeol back, working his tongue into his mouth, shifting so he\u2019s kneeling on the couch, straddling Sungyeol\u2019s leg. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s fingers twist in his hair, and he moans when Woohyun pushes his knee against his crotch, Sungyeol grinding up shamelessly against him. The sounds he makes rush through his blood, and Woohyun grinds down against Sungyeol\u2019s thigh, his jeans uncomfortably tight.  </p><p>God, he\u2019s going to miss this, miss those noises Sungyeol makes when Woohyun kisses him like this, the sloppy way Sungyeol kisses back, whining as he pulls at Woohyun\u2019s hair. He\u2019s so damn <i>cute</i>, even when his lips are wet and swollen, and his eyes are dark as he flips Woohyun onto his back. </p><p>\"Easy there,\" Woohyun murmurs, but he drags Sungyeol down, their legs tangling as he kisses him again, and again. He bends his leg, Sungyeol hard against him. </p><p>\"Ahhh\u2026you\u2026\" Sungyeol moans, his hands fisting in Woohyun\u2019s hair, \"don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t stop\u2014\" </p><p>\"Wasn\u2019t planning on it,\" Woohyun says. He pulls away from Sungyeol\u2019s lips, kissing lightly at the side of his neck. He slides his hand down Sungyeol\u2019s back, Sungyeol arching into the touch, even as he pushes down against Woohyun\u2019s waist. </p><p>Sungyeol comes first, a long, breathy whine, as Woohyun rubs his leg against Sungyeol\u2019s crotch, and Woohyun a minute later, touching himself frantically, Sungyeol hot and heavy on top of him. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stay like that, his arm trapped between himself and Sungyeol, Sungyeol\u2019s face buried into his shoulder, the side of his neck, his hair tickling Woohyun\u2019s face. Sungyeol seems to have drifted off to sleep, or that could be Woohyun, but his arm is going painfully numb. </p><p>\"I need to do the dishes,\" he says quietly, tugging his arm free. </p><p>Sungyeol turns his head, and Woohyun brushes his hair out of his eyes. </p><p>\"They can wait,\" Sungyeol says, and settles himself a little more firmly against Woohyun. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s heart skips, and he swallows it down. </p><p>\"Let me put the food away, at least,\" he says, and he pushes Sungyeol off to the side, sliding off the couch. Sungyeol groans and rolls onto his side, and Woohyun gives him a pat on the head before he heads to the kitchen. </p><p>By the time Woohyun\u2019s cleaned up, Sungyeol seems to have fallen asleep entirely. He sleeps a lot more these days, he\u2019s tired a lot more these days. His chest rises and falls in slow breaths, and his body is too long for the couch, curled up with his legs bent and he still doesn\u2019t fit. His head is pillowed on one arm, and the other is held in front of him, as if holding something invisible to his chest. Woohyun swallows again. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t bother closing the door when he showers, and with his back is turned, he doesn\u2019t realise Sungyeol\u2019s in the bathroom with him until he says, \"mind if I join?\" </p><p>It\u2019s a credit to himself that he turns around slowly, and Sungyeol\u2019s shadow is behind the frosted glass, the water still so hot that it scalds his skin. A thousand things to say fly through his mind\u2014already?, good morning sleeping beauty, can\u2019t this wait, what the fuck I\u2019m showering here, I\u2019m naked go away, yes, I mind\u2014yes. </p><p>\"Nothing I haven\u2019t seen before,\" Woohyun says wryly, turning the heat down, and Sungyeol chuckles. </p><p>It\u2019s cold, as Woohyun moves aside to give Sungyeol some room, and it\u2019s true, it\u2019s nothing Woohyun hasn\u2019t seen before\u2014but not something he\u2019s seen under bright white fluorescence, open and unabashed, instead of hidden in half shadows and greyed light. And he\u2019s <i>tall</i>\u2014of course he\u2019s tall, he\u2019s always tall, but uninterrupted by the broken lines of clothes, water streaming down from his shoulders to his collar bones, waist, hips, legs\u2014he\u2019s tall. He sticks his head underneath the showerhead, and it courses down his face, hair plastered down, until he shakes it off like a dog, droplets of water hitting Woohyun. </p><p>\"You\u2019re done?\" he says to Woohyun over his shoulder, and his lips are quirked in that half laugh. </p><p>\"Done what?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Showering,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun takes the half step forward that presses his chest to his back, and wraps his arms around him, skin to skin to skin. </p><p>\"Maybe,\" Woohyun says, and there\u2019s water in his eyes as Sungyeol turns and pushes Woohyun against the shower wall. </p><p>They tumble into bed, clean, dry, hair wet and still dripping, despite the toweling. Woohyun has Sungyeol under him even before Sungyeol\u2019s near, tripping him so he falls heavily on his back against the soft mattress. No clothes, no point, and Woohyun sucks greedy marks against Sungyeol\u2019s skin until Sungyeol is writhing. But Sungyeol is Sungyeol, and Woohyun lets him, eventually, turn their positions. There\u2019s the light in the kitchen, but his room is dim, and Woohyun, briefly, thinks about turning on the lights, because he wishes he could see more clearly the way Sungyeol is looking down on him right now, his hands holding down Woohyun\u2019s shoulders, but then Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is against his, against his neck, his shoulder, his collar bones and it trails down, sucking kisses in its path. He pauses, and it\u2019s Woohyun who\u2019s whining for him not to stop, who hooks a leg around Sungyeol, Sungyeol whose mouth is suddenly hot around Woohyun\u2019s nipple and <i>shit</i> his tongue, his thoughts flee and they stay gone, Sungyeol\u2019s teeth scraping against his hip and\u2014 </p><p>Sungyeol has always been impatient, takes Woohyun\u2019s entire length into his mouth, and his fingers grip Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders, then tangle in his hair, pushing him down because Sungyeol\u2019s impatient but he\u2019s also a dick and he pulls back, and Woohyun could swear he\u2019s laughing. </p><p>\"Fucking ass,\" Woohyun breathes, and Sungyeol\u2019s definitely laughing as he catches the head of Woohyun\u2019s cock in his mouth. </p><p>\"Mmhmmm,\" Sungyeol hums, and it\u2019s any guess as to what he means but it travels up his dick and <i>fuck</i>, fuck, when\u2019s the last time Sungyeol\u2019d sucked him off. A half formed quip\u2014finally putting that mouth of yours to good use\u2014but it never makes it off his tongue, he\u2019s so wound up and Sungyeol\u2019s tongue is pressed against the underside of his cock. </p><p>By the time they pull away, sweaty and out of breath, a handspan apart, facing each other on the bed, it\u2019s well into the new day. Woohyun watches as Sungyeol\u2019s eyes fall shut, too heavy with sleepiness to stay open, before he brushes his hair away from his face. He could, he thinks softly, get used to this\u2014again. </p><p>The sun, in the morning, is white and piercing, even through the closed blinds. Sungyeol is still half asleep beside him, but when Woohyun runs his hand down his arm, he turns, and he\u2019s awake. </p><p>\"Late night?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"And whose fault is that?\" Sungyeol asks, his words softened by sleep. </p><p>\"You want coffee?\" Woohyun asks, and he takes Sungyeol\u2019s half hearted nod to mean yes. </p><p>It\u2019s nearly noon, and Sungyeol follows him out some ten minutes later, a white t-shirt and sweatpants. Woohyun debates between breakfast and lunch, but at least the coffee's done by the time Sungyeol stumbles into the kitchen. He\u2019s not Sungyeol, all him and Sunggyu have is one of those cheap black drip makers, half price from one of those back to school sales, who knew how many years ago. Woohyun had meant to get something nicer, last year\u2014but he doesn\u2019t drink enough coffee, and he\u2019d never gotten around to it. Maybe he should. </p><p>Sungyeol moves around the kitchen, and Woohyun makes the rice. There\u2019s bagels in the freezer, but Sungyeol knows that, and he can get it himself, if he wants. Woohyun hums as he looks for leftovers and whatever\u2019s around to throw together for lunch, and it\u2019s a good thing they were planning on doing groceries this afternoon, because there\u2019s really not much around. </p><p>\"Here,\" Sungyeol says at one point, and Woohyun is pleasantly surprised to find Sungyeol shoving a mug of coffee at him. </p><p>\"I made enough for two?\" Woohyun frowns. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, even though Woohyun knows he hadn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t say that, though, just takes it and smiles into the coffee. </p><p>By the time he finishes putting together a meal, Sungyeol\u2019s disappeared. He finds him on his bed, and Sungyeol opens his eyes when Woohyun walks in. </p><p>\"Wow, I must\u2019ve really tired you out last night,\" Woohyun chuckles. The bed sinks under his weight, and Sungyeol sits up, yawning. He slides over to the side of the bed, and Woohyun catches him by the shoulder. Sungyeol tenses visibly, before he relaxes, and lets Woohyun pull him close. Sungyeol\u2019s still drowsy, despite the coffee, and Woohyun smiles as Sungyeol\u2019s hands are loose around his waist.  </p><p>Woohyun presses a soft kiss against Sungyeol\u2019s lips, and when he doesn\u2019t respond, he flicks his tongue out. Sungyeol\u2019s arms tighten around him, and Woohyun traces his hand up Sungyeol\u2019s back as he teases at Sungyeol\u2019s mouth with his tongue. The afternoon sun is piercing, reflecting off ice covered snow on the window sill, and Woohyun closes his eyes against the glare, slowly kissing Sungyeol until he\u2019s pressed up against him. Sungyeol\u2019s hand is pressed against his waist, and Woohyun covers it with his own, his other hand at the nape of Sungyeol\u2019s neck.  </p><p>A mark Woohyun had left the previous night is just visible where Sungyeol\u2019s shirt is a little loose, and slides off his shoulder. Woohyun runs a finger over it, and catches the same spot between his lips, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers dig into his waist as he plays against the skin with his tongue. </p><p>Sungyeol leans back, pulls away, slides away. </p><p>\"We should stop,\" he says. He glances at the door. </p><p>Woohyun frowns. \"Sunggyu\u2019s gone until Monday,\" he says, but when he leans in again, Sungyeol shakes his head. </p><p>\"That\u2019s not what I mean,\" he says, and his eyes don\u2019t meet Woohyun\u2019s. </p><p>His heart goes cold, and Sungyeol\u2019s words hit him like a truck, a torrent of cold water. </p><p>\"Then why stop?\" Woohyun says, but the words sound hollow to his own ears. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t mean now\u2014\" Sungyeol says, then shakes his head in frustration. </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"No, just\u2026listen to me okay?\" and Sungyeol has his hands balled into fists and he\u2019s resolutely not facing Woohyun. \"Just\u2026shut up and listen\u2014fuck, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\" </p><p>\"Just say it,\" Woohyun says. He chuckles drily. \"I was hoping we weren\u2019t going to talk about this.\" </p><p>\"We should stop, take a step back,\" Sungyeol repeats, and he\u2019s still not looking at Woohyun, and he swallows. \"We never did talk\u2026about it.\" </p><p>\"And whose fault was that?\" Woohyun asks, because he remembers this, remembers asking Sungyeol, a country apart, if he wanted to Skype, if he wanted to call, but it was always too late, too early, too busy. </p><p>\"I <i>meant</i> to,\" Sungyeol says quietly, and Woohyun realises he\u2019d said that aloud, his words full of bitterness. </p><p>\"I thought you hated me,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"What?\" Sungyeol\u2019s eyes snap towards him, wide. \"Why would I ever?\" </p><p>\"Well, you did ignore me for three months,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t <i>hate</i> you,\" Sungyeol says. He looks at his hands. His voice goes so quiet, Woohyun can barely hear him. \"You\u2019re the one who should hate me.\" </p><p>Woohyun blows out a puff of frustration. \"What does that have to do with any of <i>this</i>?\" he says. \"It\u2019s been a <i>year</i>, it\u2019s a bit too late for this, isn\u2019t it?\" </p><p>\"Everything! It has everything to do with it\u2014we\u2019re not boyfriends, alright? We\u2019re not dating, we stopped!\" </p><p>I know, I know, I know, pounds in Woohyun\u2019s head.  </p><p>\"It\u2019s just <i>sex</i>,\" Woohyun says. \"We don\u2019t need to be dating for\u2014\" </p><p>\"But it\u2019s not, is it?\" Sungyeol says, and there\u2019s already the faint trace of red in his eyes. \"Not for you.\" </p><p>\"What\u2026\" </p><p>\"You\u2019d have to be blind\u2014I\u2019m not, we\u2019re not dating, we\u2019re not going to, and it\u2019s <i>not</i> just sex for you! You have feelings, and I don\u2019t want to hurt those feelings!\" Sungyeol\u2019s voice builds up into a note of hysteria, and Woohyun clutches the sheets between his fingers. </p><p>\"So what if I have feelings?\" he says flatly. </p><p>\"Look, I\u2019m going to find some nice girl, settle down, maybe you are too, we can\u2019t <i>do</i> this,\" Sungyeol says, and yeah, it\u2019s slightly hysterical now, and Woohyun\u2019s chest is so tight it feels like he\u2019s the one crushing it in his own fist. \"We need to stop, you need to stop\u2014\" </p><p>\"So you\u2019re just going to decide for us? For me?\" </p><p>\"Yeah! Yeah, I am, because I don\u2019t want to hurt you again!\" </p><p>\"And what if\u2014\" He stops, because his phone is ringing. Woohyun bites at his lip, and takes a deep breath, because even though it feels like he can\u2019t breathe, he\u2019s breathing hard. He stares at Sungyeol, and Sungyeol\u2019s cheeks are pink, and he\u2019s breathing hard too, but not because they\u2019ve just pulled away from each other after tangling on the couch. (But maybe they\u2019re pulling away from each other in another way, the same way, a different way.) The phone stops, and in the silence, his heart is loud in his own ears. His blood rushes through him, and fire prickles at his skin. A moment, and then it starts ringing again.  </p><p>\"I need to take this,\" Woohyun says hollowly. He stands, leaving Sungyeol sitting alone on the bed, staring at his hands, at the floor. </p><p>It\u2019s his mom, and he waits until he\u2019s out of the room, before he picks up. </p><p>\"Mom? Isn\u2019t this too early for you\u2014oh, right, it\u2019s afternoon already, I just woke up late, no, you didn\u2019t wake me up, I was just in the bathroom.\" Woohyun wasn\u2019t, but he is in the bathroom now, and he pulls the door shut behind him, sinking down to the floor, leaning against it. A faint sliver of light glints off the glass of the shower. </p><p>\"Have you had a chance to think about it?\" his mom asks, and Woohyun drags his hand down his face. \"I don\u2019t mean to push you, but if you\u2019ve already made a decision\u2026\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s a pretty big decision,\" Woohyun says, and he laughs a little. \"I have been thinking about it a lot.\" </p><p>\"Would it help if we talked about it? I know you talked about it with your dad too, he said that you were thinking about it\u2014Woohyun, if you did move with us, your grandma would be so happy,\" his mom says, and she sounds so hopeful that Woohyun wonders if yes, yes he could just throw away everything here, tear himself out of this life and build up a new one, how hard could it be? </p><p>But: \"I don\u2019t know, mom,\" he says. \"Korea\u2019s very far away, much further away than California.\" </p><p>\"Of course, that\u2019s why,\" his mom says.  </p><p>\"But it\u2019s like dad said\u2014if I moved with you to Korea, it\u2019ll be hard for me, but I <i>do</i> want to see everyone more.\" Woohyun settles himself a little more comfortably against the cold tile.  </p><p>\"That\u2019s right, will you be visiting soon?\" </p><p>\"California or Korea?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"Here, silly,\" his mom says. \"It\u2019d be a shame if you never saw this place before we left. It\u2019s so warm and the weather\u2019s so nice\u2014I\u2019ve shown you the pictures, you can see the ocean from the bedroom!\" </p><p>\"When are you leaving?\" Woohyun asks. </p><p>\"April or May,\" she says, and that makes sense, but it\u2019s so soon, and he\u2019s only had a month\u2014two months, more than that\u2014to think about it, and... </p><p>\"If I go,\" he says slowly, \"when should I know? When should I\u2026decide?\" </p><p>\"Oh, my child, are you thinking about it?\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know, mom,\" he says. \"I mean, I am thinking about it, I just don\u2019t know if\u2026\" he laughs a little drily. </p><p>\"February,\" she says, \"let\u2019s say February, but there\u2019s no rush, you don\u2019t need to ride on a plane with us. You\u2019re much older now.\" </p><p>There\u2019s a sound on the other side of the door, and Woohyun swallows. </p><p>(When it rains, it pours.) </p><p>\"Can we talk later?\" he says. \"My friend is here\u2014Sungyeol, from university\u2014I think he\u2019s getting a little impatient.\" </p><p>His mom laughs, and he misses her so much, so, so, much. He should tell her they should Skype, after. He wants to see her so much. </p><p>\"Of course,\" she says. \"Go have fun. You know I love you so much, right?\" </p><p>\"Me too,\" he says, and eventually, he does have to hang up. He sits with the silence for a few moments, phone warm in his hand. But Sungyeol is still on the other side of the door, and eventually, he does have to stand, and eventually, he does have to face Sungyeol. Face himself. </p><p>But: </p><p>\"You\u2019re moving to Korea?\" </p><p>Sungyeol is standing just outside the door, and his hand is on the wall, and his face is the very picture of surprise. </p><p>\"Didn\u2019t someone tell you it\u2019s rude to eavesdrop?\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"You\u2019re <i>moving to Korea</i>?\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t know,\" Woohyun says. \"Can we talk about this later?\" </p><p>\"You\u2019ve never lived in Korea,\" Sungyeol says, and his brows are furrowed in maybe it\u2019s worry, if Woohyun squints. </p><p>\"I moved here from Korea,\" Woohyun points out\u2014when he was seven, but he still had\u2014\"and I said, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure.\" </p><p>\"When?\" </p><p>\"I just said I don\u2019t know, didn\u2019t I?\" Woohyun snaps. He pushes past Sungyeol and his outstretched arm. He looks at his bedroom, and then at the couch. The smell of fresh cooked rice floats out from the kitchen, and Woohyun slips his phone into his pocket. </p><p>\"We had a conversation to finish,\" Woohyun says. It sounds tired even to his own ears. A conversation a year late. </p><p>\"Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\" Sungyeol says, and his voice is accusatory, and Woohyun laughs, shaking his head in disbelief.  </p><p>\"You\u2019re kidding, right?\" Woohyun turns, snorting. Like you told me? \"Why would I tell <i>you</i>?\" </p><p>\"Because\u2026because we\u2019re <i>friends</i>,\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"Are we?\" Woohyun says, quietly. \"I don\u2019t know what you want us to be anymore.\" </p><p>\"Friends,\" Sungyeol says. \"I want us to be friends, don\u2019t you get it?\" </p><p>\"I did say that, didn\u2019t I? I get it, we\u2019re friends\u2014you never said why, you just\u2014\" Woohyun shakes his head in frustration. He runs his hands through his hair, paces to the couch, leans his hands against it. \"I really thought you hated me, you know? Or you got tired of me, you wouldn\u2019t be the first\u2014\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s because I\u2019m not good for you! Because all I\u2019m ever going to do is hurt you, because I\u2019m a dick, alright? I\u2026 Fucking hell, Woohyun, I <i>punched you in the face</i>.\" </p><p>\"That was just once\u2014\" </p><p>\"Are you listening to yourself?\" </p><p>\"So what, you lost your temper, call me when there\u2019s real news\u2014Sungyeol, I barely <i>remember</i> that.\" </p><p>\"Then maybe\u2014maybe I just don\u2019t like you that way,\" Sungyeol says\u2014like he\u2019s trying to convince himself, and it\u2019s so petulant, that Woohyun has to laugh. He whirls, and Sungyeol\u2019s standing in the middle of his living room, and he\u2019s so awkward and tall and not out of place enough. He\u2019s standing there, and Woohyun has never more wanted to punch someone before, never wanted to punch Sungyeol more, not even when he belittled him in front of an entire class of his students. </p><p>\"'Thank you for being born,'\" Woohyun murmurs to himself. He lets out a deep breath, and he turns around again, because he can\u2019t meet Sungyeol\u2019s eyes that aren\u2019t meeting his at all. \"You remember saying that? And I laughed because that\u2019s cheesier than anything I ever said?\" </p><p>\"That was you!\" Sungyeol says. \"I just\u2026said it back!\" </p><p>\"You meant it though, and it wasn\u2019t as friends,\" Woohyun says. \"That time, I really thought that\u2026\" </p><p>Woohyun trails off, because for brief moments, he\u2019s been thinking that again, when they were leaning against each other on the couch, when Sungyeol had his arms around Woohyun as Woohyun did the dishes, when Sungyeol would look at him, after, with eyes that could\u2019ve melted Woohyun\u2019s heart a thousand times over. </p><p>\"I <i>punched</i> you,\" Sungyeol says again, then he growls in frustration. \"Fine, I do like you, okay? And you deserve someone better!\" </p><p>\"And you get to decide who that is? You say my ego\u2019s big? What about yours?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m trying to be serious\u2014\" </p><p>\"And so am I?\"  </p><p>\"So just listen to what I\u2019m saying, damn it!\" </p><p>Woohyun scoffs. \"I am listening to you, and guess what, you don\u2019t get to decide my 'feelings'. I\u2019m the only one who gets to decide if they\u2019re hurt or\u2014\" </p><p>\"But I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to hurt you, you\u2014\" </p><p>\"What name are you going to call me now?\" Woohyun asks, because he\u2019s turned and Sungyeol has that look on his face. \"Listen to me, Lee Sungyeol, what do you want? Forget if I get hurt or not, forget\u2014\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t, you asshole! That\u2019s the whole point\u2014you don\u2019t get it, I already hurt you, didn\u2019t I? What if I had hated you? What if I <i>wanted</i> to hurt you?\" Sungyeol spits the words out, as if they're poison against his tongue. \"You want to do that again?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol\u2014\" </p><p>\"Maybe I\u2019m just not ready, maybe I can\u2019t do this whole relationship thing, and I\u2019m just not good for you!\" </p><p>\"Does it matter? I don\u2019t, I just\u2014you\u2019re not ready, alright,  you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good for me, fine, but what if I want to be good for you? Are you saying I\u2019m not, I can\u2019t do that?\" </p><p>\"Of course not, I\u2019m saying\u2014\" </p><p>\"Then what\u2019s the problem? What if that\u2019s what I want?\" Woohyun says, but he knows the problem, and the problem is that he\u2019s the one being selfish\u2014he knows that Sungyeol might be all barbs and thorns on the outside, but that, yeah, he\u2019s right. It couldn\u2019t have lasted, and one day Sungyeol\u2019s going to say, again, let\u2019s stop, and Woohyun will feel his heart crumple into itself, like it had last winter, and like it\u2019s doing right now, and like it had every time Sungyeol had locked him out of his life, and he\u2019s right. </p><p>He\u2019s right, because Woohyun takes things to heart, and so does Sungyeol, and he\u2019s being selfish because he knows that Sungyeol knows that and every time, it\u2019s Sungyeol who gets hurt too. But right now\u2014right now, he wants to be selfish. </p><p>\"But what if that\u2019s not what I want?\" Sungyeol asks. \"What if I really just want to stop?\" </p><p>\"Which part?\" Woohyun asks, and Sungyeol\u2019s eyes have dropped again. \"Me, or 'hurting' me?\" </p><p>Sungyeol hesitates. \"You,\" he says softly, but he still doesn\u2019t meet Woohyun\u2019s eyes. </p><p>\"Don\u2019t lie to me,\" Woohyun says. \"Don\u2019t lie to yourself.\" </p><p>\"I\u2019m <i>not</i>,\" Sungyeol says, but he\u2019s always been a terrible liar, and he\u2019s always been an open book, and he knows this too. </p><p>\"You don\u2019t want to stop,\" Woohyun says slowly. \"But you don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings.\" </p><p>\"Not everything has to have feelings attached,\" Sungyeol says. He sits, folding his legs in front of him. \"Only if\u2026only if you promise that.\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t, Sungyeol,\" Woohyun says, and he knows that he should lie, here, but he\u2019s never been a good liar either. No, he\u2019s always been a good liar, he\u2019s just never been good at lying. </p><p>\"You know I can\u2019t,\" Woohyun adds, several beats later. </p><p>\"Then I don\u2019t,\" Sungyeol says. \"I don\u2019t want it. See, it\u2019s not just sex. For you.\" </p><p>\"I can\u2019t,\" Woohyun pushes on, and Sungyeol\u2019s speaking into his knees, his voice thick, and Woohyun\u2019s speaking to the crown of his head, \"but pretend that I can. Please, Sungyeol\u2014I don\u2019t want to stop, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t want to go back.\" </p><p>He wants to sit next to him, wants to wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him close, but that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants, he\u2019s sure about that. (Then why, if he knows that\u2019s not what Sungyeol wants, does he want this\u2014because, in a way, Sungyeol does want this, and he knows that too.) </p><p>Woohyun laughs drily. \"I\u2019ll get hurt either way, right? So at least let me get hurt and not regret anything.\" </p><p>\"What if you do regret it?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>Woohyun takes a step back, and a deep breath. They tease Sungyeol, calling him a kid, and he\u2019s not, but right now, he reminds him of one. He reminds him of a kid, lost in the mall, and he doesn\u2019t know where to start looking for someone he knows. </p><p>\"I told you, didn\u2019t I? Regret or not, hurt or not, that\u2019s not for you to decide. I don\u2019t want to do anything you don\u2019t want to do\u2014but if you want to do something that I want to do\u2026\" Woohyun breathes out, sucks in air, and when he breathes out again, it\u2019s a shuddering breath that comes dangerously close to something he doesn\u2019t want to admit, and he sits as well, because his legs feel like they\u2019re going to give out under him. \"I don\u2019t want to step back, Sungyeol, and if you want this, if you want to do this without feelings, then let\u2019s do that. I\u2019m fine with that.\" </p><p>\"Even if I punch you again?\" </p><p>\"I\u2019d rather not,\" Woohyun says, \"unless I really deserve it again. I don\u2019t <i>care</i>, Yeol, it\u2019s just sex, right?\" </p><p>\"But I care, I don\u2019t want\u2026\" to hurt you, he\u2019s going to say, but Woohyun\u2019s heard that enough, and he knows that enough, and he\u2019s selfish, he\u2019s so selfish. </p><p>\"Let me pretend,\" he says. </p><p>\"What if there\u2019s some girl?\" Sungyeol says. </p><p>\"So you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want to hurt me, but you don\u2019t mind hurting her?\" Woohyun asks, amused. </p><p>\"No, I\u2019m just saying that\u2014\"  </p><p>\"Do you have some girl?\" Woohyun asks, cutting off Sungyeol\u2019s frustration. </p><p>\"You\u2019d know if I did,\" Sungyeol glowers, and he finally raises his head, furiously wiping at his eyes with the back of his hand. </p><p>He could get him tissues, or a roll of toilet paper because they don\u2019t have tissues, but Woohyun just pulls his knees to his chest in a mirror image. \"I always was the one who wanted this,\" Woohyun says. Sungyeol glances up in surprise, and Woohyun feels his lips stretch in a half smile. \"You told me you weren\u2019t sure if you were ready for commitment, and I told you we\u2019d play it by ear\u2014so last winter, now, it\u2019s not you. Stop kicking yourself over it\u2014I know you are, I know you well enough for that.\" </p><p>\"I could say the same,\" Sungyeol says, and it\u2019s horribly choked. </p><p>Woohyun swallows, and stands. The rice is done. \"Let\u2019s eat,\" he says. \"It\u2019s getting late.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, and he hears Sungyeol stand as well, behind him. </p><p>\"Want to go play billiards after?\" Woohyun asks. \"See if Myungsoo\u2019s up for coming downtown.\" </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Sungyeol says, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t know if he wants to know what his answer is.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A cold spray mists against their faces, splashing inwards from the wall of water in front of them. The day is threatening rain, but it\u2019s humid and hot and sticky and Sungyeol just laughs with glee as he drags Woohyun up against the railing. Children shriek with delight as they do the same, pulling unwilling parents along, families posing for pictures, covered in thin plastic raincoats, toddlers hanging back as their older siblings encourage them forward. The light that filters in through the falls dances off the spray carried in with it.  </p><p>\"I\u2019m wearing a white shirt!\" Woohyun protests. </p><p>\"That\u2019s even better!\" Sungyeol says, voice raised to make himself heard as the torrential fall crashes through air and against the river below. </p><p>\"Why didn\u2019t you let us put on the ponchos again?\" Woohyun says, but Sungyeol is leaning over the railing, head and hands reaching as close to the waterfall as he can. Droplets of water drip down from the ends of his hair, and it glistens against his face. His wide mouthed laughter is contagious, and his shirt is quickly going from damp to straight up wet. Woohyun snorts, shaking his head fondly. </p><p>\"Say cheese!\" Woohyun says, snapping a picture before Sungyeol turns, then catching another as Sungyeol\u2019s head whips around, eyes wide. </p><p>\"You could\u2019ve warned me,\" he complains, but in the next moment, he has an arm around Woohyun\u2019s shoulders, and takes a picture of the both of them with his phone. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s hair is soaked, and the water drips against Woohyun\u2019s face. On the screen, Sungyeol\u2019s free hand, held up in a V, blocks half of Woohyun\u2019s face. </p><p>\"You can\u2019t even see me!\" Woohyun points out\u2014then freezes, because Sungyeol on the screen has turned his head, and Sungyeol next to him\u2014his lips brush against Woohyun\u2019s cheek. </p><p>\"You could\u2019ve warned me,\" Woohyun says, after he gets over the surprise. He\u2019s looking at Sungyeol, but Sungyeol\u2019s phone is still held up at an angle, and later, Woohyun will see himself, smiling at Sungyeol with a far too sappy look on his face. His shirt <i>is</i> wet, and his shoulder, soaked from Sungyeol leaning against him, shows through the white fabric, translucent. Droplets of water catch against his lashes, and his eyes are curled in fondness. But right now, he pulls away from Sungyeol in mock annoyance. \"Jeez, you\u2019re so wet!\" </p><p>\"That just means you\u2019re not wet enough,\" Sungyeol says, and the quirk of his eyebrows is telling enough. </p><p>\"Come on,\" Woohyun says, tugging Sungyeol away to give other people a chance to take pictures behind the falls. \"You still want ice cream?\" </p><p>\"Can we go to the lower deck again?\" Sungyeol says, and he means the one where the falls roar the loudest, and where it might as well <i>be</i> raining, with how much water it throws up. Woohyun shivers from the thought, but he grabs Sungyeol\u2019s hand and leads him down the tunnels hewn into the rock. He laces their fingers together, and Sungyeol squeezes his hand back.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Woohyun\u2019s <i>pissed</i>, and he shouldn\u2019t be, but he\u2019s had it, he\u2019s done with Sungyeol ignoring his texts, ignoring his calls, ignoring his fucking concern when he\u2019s so obviously <i>miserable</i>. He\u2019s done with Sungyeol putting on that shitty happy face he\u2019s terrible at, that Myungsoo sees through just as well, that almost everyone sees through, but then when he\u2019s with Woohyun, he doesn\u2019t even try\u2014and maybe Woohyun should be flattered, if Sungyeol would only <i>look</i> at him.  </p><p>\"You really are a piece of shit, you know that?\" Woohyun snarls. \"Get over yourself, get over whatever ridiculous self pity party you\u2019re throwing yourself! I just asked what\u2019s up with your mood, so stop acting like a three year old throwing a tantrum!\" </p><p>\"And I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, alright?\" and Sungyeol\u2019s jaw is set, teeth gritted. </p><p>\"My baby nephew is more reasonable than you are,\" Woohyun goads, and there\u2019s a flash of anger in Sungyeol\u2019s eyes, and a twisted flash of satisfaction in Woohyun\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The first time Woohyun sees Sungyeol, he barely remembers him, because he\u2019s too busy projecting an air of self confidence he doesn\u2019t feel. </p><p>The first time Woohyun sees Sungyeol as Sungyeol, and not bratty kid in the first and only class he ever teaches, is when Sungyeol\u2019s laughing, head thrown back, mouth stretched unattractively, as his friend tells him a horrible joke, and they\u2019ve been studying together for months now\u2014his heart flips. </p><p>(He won\u2019t recognise the moment for what it was until months later. But maybe it was never Sungyeol. Maybe it was always the image of Sungyeol.)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Sungyeol returns from his parents' after New Year's, and Woohyun hasn\u2019t spoken to him since he left after billiards, that day. </p><p>He video calls his parents, and his brother, and his grandparents, and after, he gets into the shower and lets the water stream down his face, washing it all away. Woohyun spends Christmas with Myungsoo\u2019s family, and they feed him well, like they always do, and they call him charming and he tells them that Myungsoo is lucky to have such a wonderful family. Kibum goes on vacation with a couple friends of his from university, and the office is echoingly empty in those days between Christmas and New Years, as they always are. </p><p>The streets are crowded and excited as he walks home from work, the day after Christmas. He takes a detour north to the main street, and walks along the window displays, strung bright with lights and festively decorated mannequins. He walks past the intersection where Sungyeol had fallen, the concrete building housing the department store with the steps, and the big library\u2019s a bit further down the world\u2019s longest street, and the glass windows of the bank across the street reflect the crowds that surge through the intersection, when the lights stop the cars and open up the streets for the pedestrians. Woohyun lingers before he continues onwards, past the fancy hotels, the bookstore, the Gucci and the Hermes and the rest of the stores for clientele with far more cash to throw around than he\u2019ll probably ever have. The museum to his left stands in all its crystal glory, shards of some glass spaceship growing out of the stately stone building below. The buildings grow into a mix of brick and glass, the school across the street a remnant of the early 1900s with its stone columns and rounded front. His mind wanders, as he pushes alone through the crowds. It\u2019s not a cold day, and it draws people out into the late afternoon. It\u2019s only when it lets up, does he realise he\u2019s at the subway station\u2014Sungyeol\u2019s station. It was a white Christmas, and the park across the street is filled with children\u2019s delighted shrieks, flying down the flattest parts of the steep hill in plastic sleds. It\u2019s getting late\u2014he gets on the subway, and rides it all the way home. </p><p>\"Please make up with Sungyeol before you make my life miserable.\" Sunggyu corners him a few days into the new year. </p><p>\"What?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol isn\u2019t nearly as quiet as he thinks he is,\" Sunggyu says darkly. \"And neither are you.\" </p><p>\"Wait <i>what</i>?\" </p><p>\"What I\u2019m saying is, take care of whatever this cloud you have is about\u2014I\u2019d rather have the two of you singing shitty Christmas carols,\" Sunggyu says, and leaves Woohyun standing in the kitchen, too shocked to retort that Christmas carols were a perfectly apt representation of love and joy. </p><p>His brother messages him one day\u2014are you coming? he wants to know, and Woohyun asks if he\u2019s awake to talk. </p><p>\"Are you really going to? Mom thinks you are,\" he says. </p><p>\"What would you do, hyung?\" </p><p>\"Well, I\u2019m here now, aren\u2019t I?\" </p><p>\"Yeah, but that was <i>high school</i>\u2014I have a job, friends\u2026\" </p><p>\"I had friends too,\" his brother points out. There\u2019s a long pause. \"I know, it\u2019s not the same at all.\" </p><p>\"I don\u2019t\u2026\" Woohyun hesitates, his teeth catching on his lip. \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in.\" </p><p>\"You? You\u2019ve always been the good one at fitting in,\" his brother says. </p><p>\"Fake it until you make it,\" Woohyun chuckles. And then: \"I\u2019ve spent too much time here to ever be truly Korean.\" </p><p>\"That doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" his brother says, and then, quietly: \"but you\u2019ll never be truly anything,\" and Woohyun remembers his brother saying that years ago, and not knowing what he\u2019d meant. He thinks he knows, a little, now. </p><p>\"Thanks, hyung. I guess I\u2019d rather think of it as being a bit of everything.\" </p><p>But still, the image of home beckons. A home he doesn\u2019t remember, a home that hasn\u2019t been his for as long as he can remember, except for visits over the summer that became increasingly sparse as he\u2019d grown older, and as he began spending summers with friends and things that\u2019d look good on his resume. And then he was working, or he was taking classes, and it becomes relegated to a week here and there, every few years\u2014last year was the longest since he\u2019d been in middle school, and he\u2019d been painfully aware of the differences in his clothes, in his speech, in the smallest ways of thinking and habits. But still. </p><p>(It\u2019s a nostalgia that\u2019s never been his, but he clings to it nevertheless.) </p><p>They run into each other one day, Woohyun leaving the hair salon, Sungyeol carrying take-out. </p><p>\"Hey,\" Woohyun says. </p><p>\"Hey.\" </p><p>\"How were your holidays?\" </p><p>\"They were alright. You?\" </p><p>\"Sungyeol, about last time\u2014\" </p><p>\"It\u2019s fine,\" Sungyeol says. \"Let\u2019s just pretend it never happened.\" </p><p>Woohyun snorts, shaking his head. \"It doesn\u2019t work like that,\" he says. And then: \"you think there\u2019s enough there for the two of us?\" </p><p>Sungyeol looks at the take-out container he\u2019s holding, and then back at Woohyun. \"Probably,\" he says, and Woohyun takes that as a yes\u2014and Sungyeol takes that as a yes. </p><p>The door hasn\u2019t even closed before Woohyun\u2019s pushing Sungyeol up against it, and it clicks shut with a sudden stop. Woohyun tangles his fingers in Sungyeol\u2019s hair, and it\u2019s a song that\u2019s been played too many times, kissing him hungrily, like it\u2019s been a year instead of a month. Bad life decisions, he thinks, but it\u2019s hard to when he\u2019s pressed his leg against Sungyeol, and Sungyeol is grinding up against him. It\u2019s been a month, but Woohyun has never felt more desperate, and he fumbles with the buttons on Sungyeol\u2019s coat, before he gives up and fumbles with the button on Sungyeol\u2019s jeans. Sungyeol moans at the touch, and his fingers push away Woohyun\u2019s, finishing the job much sooner. Woohyun mouths at Sungyeol\u2019s neck, but his hand\u2019s already down Sungyeol\u2019s pants. </p><p>\"Shit\u2014cold,\" Sungyeol hisses. Woohyun wraps his fingers around Sungyeol\u2019s dick, and he ignores Sungyeol\u2019s fingers digging into the back of his neck. Hurts like hell, but Sungyeol\u2019s always been like that, just like how he ruts up into Woohyun\u2019s hand anyway, and he\u2019s hot and heavy and Woohyun will never get tired of the sounds Sungyeol makes, the one that says don\u2019t stop, the one that says faster, the one that says please, please, please, without any words at all.  </p><p>Sungyeol comes into his hand, and Woohyun works him through it, until Sungyeol leans against him, spent. Lazily, slowly, he does the same for Woohyun, until they\u2019re both boneless and loose. </p><p>It\u2019s not quite enough for two, because Sungyeol hadn\u2019t gotten enough for two. </p><p>A song with a chorus played too many times, Sungyeol joining him after he showers\u2014he\u2019d let Woohyun go first, citing work he had to tie up\u2014in his bed.  </p><p>The lights are off, but it\u2019s better that way, Sungyeol running his hands along Woohyun\u2019s body, his fingers thin and cool. They catch on the ridges of his spine, until it cups the back of Woohyun\u2019s neck. Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is hot against his, and his body is hot against him, even though the water still damp in Sungyeol\u2019s hair is cool against him. The heat floods his body, floods his mind, and Sungyeol\u2019s hard against his thigh, and Woohyun wonders why he\u2019d bothered getting dressed after his shower at all. </p><p>(Woohyun had too, because Woohyun knows not to hope.) </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s lips are wet and slick when Woohyun draws back just enough to take a deep breath, because they both need it, and his eyes shine in the darkness. This time, Woohyun uses a bit more teeth than necessary, and there\u2019s a quiet hiss as Sungyeol pulls away, and Woohyun\u2019s shoulders shake in quick laughter. His face is flushed\u2014Woohyun\u2019s own chest is tight, and his head is already dizzy with a need for air. Sungyeol\u2019s fingers dig into Woohyun\u2019s shoulder, and in one quick moment, Sungyeol has Woohyun pressed back against the bed, his head scraping against the wall. He\u2019s staring down at him, and Woohyun pulls him down\u2014Sungyeol kisses him hungrily, and Woohyun whines, grinding up against Sungyeol, but Sungyeol has one knee on him, and Woohyun has only empty air. </p><p>His tongue is in his mouth, exploring it as if he\u2019s never done this before. Sungyeol\u2019s hand runs down his arm, and then against his chest, his thumb teasing him where he\u2019s most sensitive. Woohyun needs to <i>breathe</i> but Sungyeol holds him down, even as he tries to pull away for air. Sungyeol smells of shampoo, and he\u2019s so hot against him, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers bruise against his shoulder\u2014Woohyun shoves, really shoves, gasping. </p><p>Sungyeol\u2019s chest is heaving, and Woohyun\u2019s is too.  </p><p>\"You dick,\" Woohyun breathes. </p><p>\"I know,\" Sungyeol says, and then his mouth is at the side of Woohyun\u2019s neck, kissing greedy marks into his skin until Woohyun is writhing, and he wishes he could turn the light on because he wishes he could see more clearly the way Sungyeol is looking down on him right now, his hands holding down Woohyun\u2019s shoulders. Woohyun wraps an arm around Sungyeol\u2019s neck, pulls up close enough to suck at the crook of his neck, and god, the sounds Sungyeol makes, and he closes his teeth lightly over it, and he knows it\u2019ll leave a mark. Sungyeol pulls away, gasping, and Woohyun\u2019s breath hitches as Sungyeol presses himself against him, and his tongue is wet and hot against Woohyun\u2019s skin. </p><p>Woohyun\u2019s hands roam Sungyeol\u2019s body, and Sungyeol whines at the touch, whines for more, and Woohyun obliges. Sungyeol grinds against his leg, and Sungyeol is so warm and solid. And then he\u2019s pushing his knee between Woohyun\u2019s legs and Woohyun whines in surprise, and Sungyeol does it again, and again, his mouth still hot against his, and his fingers clench about Sungyeol\u2019s shoulders and he pushes him away, because he wants to so badly, but he wants this to last.  </p><p>He knows he\u2019s wet, and it\u2019s absurd how wet he is, and he can feel it against the fabric of his underwear. He brings his hand down, palms Sungyeol, and Sungyeol is too\u2014Sungyeol sucks in a sharp breath, and Woohyun wraps his fingers around the bulge and squeezes just once, just enough for Sungyeol to buck up against him, but not enough for anything more. </p><p>The dark light of a city half asleep is filtering in through the window, and it\u2019s all that he can see Sungyeol by, when he opens his eyes, sees Sungyeol with his face buried in his shoulder, and Woohyun kisses at his jaw, trailing up, tongue flickering against his ear, catching his piercings in his mouth, and Sungyeol\u2019s fingers tighten against him. He plays with it, until the cold metal is warm and hot and Sungyeol\u2019s trying to push up against him but Woohyun holds him down, hand on his hip, and Woohyun doesn\u2019t know how he keeps it together, how he keeps himself tangled up and cohesive and just conscious enough to know how to touch Sungyeol so he\u2019s whining into him and on the edge and so he feels <i>good</i>, but maybe that\u2019s just something he\u2019s learned and can never forget, like riding a bike or breathing underwater.  </p><p>Sungyeol pulls away, and he\u2019s flushed hot, and he draws back just enough for Woohyun to see the want gleaming in his eyes, and Woohyun leans up, catches Sungyeol in a quick kiss, but Sungyeol has other ideas.  </p><p>He pushes Woohyun down, his mouth against his, his neck, his shoulder, his collar bones, trailing kisses down his body and Woohyun hooks a leg around Sungyeol, begging him not to stop. He pauses, and Sungyeol\u2019s mouth is suddenly hot around Woohyun\u2019s nipple and <i>shit</i>, his tongue\u2014his thoughts flee and they stay gone, Sungyeol\u2019s teeth scraping against his hip, and\u2014  </p><p>shit, his tongue plays at the head of Woohyun\u2019s cock, teasing at the slit. Woohyun\u2019s fingers tangle into Sungyeol\u2019s hair, twisting it, until Sungyeol whines and reaches up with one hand, closing his fingers around Woohyun\u2019s wrist, but his lips close around just the tip, and Woohyun has to bite back his moan. </p><p>\"There\u2019s no one here,\" Sungyeol murmurs against him. \"Let me hear you,\" and Woohyun does, because it\u2019s so hard not to, and in this moment, he wants Sungyeol to, just as much and he can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s been this loud, and Sungyeol drags it out of him, tongue pressing against the underside of his cock, and Woohyun bucks up into his mouth, pulling him so close that Sungyeol gags. </p><p>\"Fucking ass,\" Sungyeol breathes, as soon as he manages to pull away, and Woohyun laughs a breathy laugh, but it turns into something much more wanton, because his dick is in Sungyeol\u2019s mouth, and his world explodes. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Woohyun wakes to the unmistakable smell of coffee, rich and earthy, and the half of a bed long since empty, judging from how cool the covers are. He lies there for a moment, and then another. It\u2019s still early in the morning, and the sky is overcast, the light that filters in grey. It\u2019ll snow today, the weather forecast had said, but it seems uncertain if it\u2019s two centimeters or ten. </p><p>He hesitates, but he can\u2019t stay there forever, curled up under Sungyeol\u2019s blankets, in Sungyeol\u2019s bed. He sits up silently, the blood rushing from his head, his vision darkening for a moment, before Sungyeol\u2019s room is brought back into sharp focus. The carpet is soft against his feet, and Woohyun gets dressed in the same clothes he\u2019d been wearing last night, neatly folded in the corner of the room. He tosses the clothes he\u2019d slept in into Sungyeol\u2019s laundry bin. A thought crosses his mind\u2014he crouches down, pulls open the bottom drawer, and smiles when he sees his old clothes there. He pushes it shut, as quietly as he can. </p><p>\"Good morning,\" he says, as he walks to the kitchen. </p><p>Sungyeol turns, eyes sharp, and Woohyun\u2019s heart plummets\u2014but then he breaks into a smile. \"Took you long enough,\" he says. \"The coffee\u2019s nearly cold.\" </p><p>\"That\u2019s what microwaves are for,\" Woohyun says, and Sungyeol snorts in contempt. </p><p>There\u2019s the clear attempts of breakfast on the counter, and Woohyun stifles a laugh. He reaches for the messy plate of pancakes, but Sungyeol hastily slaps his hand away. </p><p>\"I mixed up the salt and sugar,\" he says sheepishly. \"Let\u2019s just have toast.\" </p><p>\"Fine with me,\" Woohyun says. He reaches for his cup, the same one he always uses when he\u2019s here. It matches Sungyeol\u2019s, a little, and Woohyun\u2019s always liked that. </p><p>The snow\u2019s started outside, sparse flakes, barely noticeable. It lends a spark to the otherwise grey melancholy of a cold winter day, and Woohyun wanders to the window, coffee in hand. Sungyeol follows him, the bread in the toaster. </p><p>\"You forgot your umbrella here,\" he says\u2014what umbrella, Woohyun says, but Sungyeol nods towards a black umbrella, folded and leaning against the wall near the door, and oh, that umbrella. </p><p>\"I thought you\u2019d stolen it,\" Woohyun jokes, and Sungyeol glowers at him. </p><p>Woohyun washes his mug after breakfast, and Sungyeol sees him to the door. It\u2019s cold, and Woohyun wraps his scarf tightly about him, until it covers the bottom half of his face. </p><p>\"See you later,\" Sungyeol says, as Woohyun opens the door. </p><p>\"Yeah,\" Woohyun says. He pauses, and Sungyeol\u2019s hand is awkward at his side. \"You\u2019re coming for my birthday thing next week?\" </p><p>\"Sure,\" Sungyeol says, and then he grins. \"Don\u2019t expect a present, though.\" </p><p>\"I never expect anything,\" Woohyun laughs, and when he walks outside, across the street from an apartment building he\u2019s just left, he thinks there\u2019s a flutter of movement by the window. </p><p>It\u2019s snowing, and Woohyun\u2019s holding a black umbrella. He knows he looks ridiculous, but he props it open anyway, trailing footsteps in the snow.</p></div>\n        <!-- end cache -->\n    </div>\n<!--/chapter-->\n\n    <!--afterword-->\n    <div class=\"afterword preface group\">\n        <!--work endnotes-->\n<div id=\"work_endnotes\" class=\"end notes module\">\n  <h3 class=\"heading\">Notes:</h3>\n  <blockquote class=\"userstuff\"><p>thank you for your friendship that has made my life so much richer\u2014i've never regretted a single moment. and thank you to my dearest meimei, who's held your useless jiejie's hand through every step of this, for far more than only this fic.</p><hr /><p>\n  <small></small>\n  <br />\n  <small>location notes:</small>\n  <br />\n  <small></small>\n  <br />\n  <small>The fic generally happens along two main streets: Bloor, between approximately Church St and Christie; Yonge, from Bloor, down to Eatons center, or Yonge-Dundas square.
